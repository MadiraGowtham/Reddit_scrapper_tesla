Elon Musk’s Trump bet has paid off so well that Tesla is now worth more than most of the rest of the car industry combined,9724,0.86,763,2024-11-11,"[https://fortune.com/2024/11/11/elon-musk-donald-trump-election-tesla-auto-industry-carmakers-market-value/](https://fortune.com/2024/11/11/elon-musk-donald-trump-election-tesla-auto-industry-carmakers-market-value/)

>Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s ‘all-in’ gamble to get Donald Trump elected president has proven so successful that a veritable chasm has opened up between his EV manufacturer and the rest of the auto industry. As conventional carmakers trade at rock-bottom prices amid a broad industry malaise brought on by China’s economic slowdown and growing fears of Trump tariffs, Tesla’s stock continues to soar, creating one of the biggest valuation gaps it’s ever seen.

>On Friday, Tesla reclaimed its place in the elite club of companies worth more than $1 trillion after adding a full third in market capitalization since Election Day less than a week ago. The last time Tesla was worth this amount of money it was April 2022, Musk had just revealed his $44 billion plan to acquire Twitter.

>Relative to its peers, Tesla is now worth more than the next 15 largest carmakers combined—from Toyota and General Motors all the way down to Jeep’s parent company Stellantis and Hyundai. Toss in lower ranked names like Kia and Renault, respectively worth $26.6 billion and $12.6 billion, and Tesla is still is still ahead, only drawing even once the $8.8 billion from Japan’s Nissan is thrown into the mix."

Tesla shares close down 12% after earnings miss for biggest slump since 2020 ,3121,0.94,486,2024-07-24,"Tesla shares plummeted the most since 2020 after the electric vehicle maker reported weaker-than-expected quarterly earnings and another drop in automotive revenue.

The stock closed down 12% on Wednesday at $215.99. It’s now down 13% for the year, while the Nasdaq is up 16% over that stretch.

Tesla on Tuesday said auto revenue declined 7% from a year earlier to $19.9 billion while margins also fell. Total revenue increased 2% to $25.5 billion.

The company has been forced to slash prices globally and offer discounts and incentives as it faces slowing sales and rising competition, especially in China.

Tesla remains the top seller of electric vehicles in the U.S. by far, but is losing market share to a growing number of rivals due in part to its aging lineup of sedans and SUVs and the impact of Musk’s incendiary and political commentary.

Adjusted earnings of 52 cents a share for the second quarter trailed the average analyst estimate of 62 cents, according to LSEG. And Tesla’s adjusted operating margin shrank to the lowest in three years, dropping to 14.4% from 18.7% a year earlier. It’s the fourth straight quarter of shrinkage.

Investors have been focused on a number of other areas around the Tesla story, including when the company will introduce a new mass-market car to reinvigorate its lineup of vehicles. Musk said on the earnings call Tuesday that Tesla is on track to deliver a new “affordable” car in the first half of next year.

Robotaxis were a big topic on the earnings call. Musk envisions a world in which owners can authorize their Tesla vehicle to be used as part of an Uber-style ride-hailing service, with the cars driving autonomously.

When asked when he expects the first robotaxi ride, Musk said, “I would be shocked if we cannot do it next year.”

Musk has a history of promising things on a particular timeline and not delivering. On Tuesday, he pushed back the date of the company’s robotaxi event to October, after previously saying it would take place in August.

“This is because I wanted to make some important changes that I think would improve the vehicle,” Musk said, adding that Tesla is “going to show up a couple of other things.” He didn’t provide details.

Tesla shares drop 6% in premarket after Cybercab robotaxi reveal fails to impress",1700,0.93,566,2024-10-11,"Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla tumbled Friday after the company’s long-awaited robotaxi event — where CEO Elon Musk unveiled the firm’s Cybercab self-driving concept car — failed to impress investors.

Tesla stock was down 5.8% as of 6:33 a.m. ET in premarket trading on Friday.

Musk revealed Tesla’s Cybercab concept vehicle — a low, silver two-seater, has no steering wheels or pedals — on Thursday night. The plan is for the car to be capable of driving itself autonomously when it launches.

The Tesla boss said the company hopes to be producing the Cybercab before 2027, but offered no details on where the cars will be manufactured. He said consumers would be able to buy a Tesla Cybercab for a price tag under $30,000.

He also said he expects Tesla to have “unsupervised FSD” up and running in Texas and California next year in the company’s Model 3 and Model Y electric vehicles. FSD, which stands for Full Self-Driving, is Tesla’s premium driver assistance system, available today in a “supervised” version for Tesla electric vehicles.

The technology still requires a human driver at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.

In reaction to the Thursday event, analysts at Barclays said that the revelations had failed to highlight any near-term opportunities for Tesla, instead prioritizing Musk’s vision for a fully autonomous driving future.

“As expected, like prior Tesla product unveils, the event was light on the details, and instead emphasized the vision underpinning Tesla’s growth endeavors in AI/AV \[autonomous vehicles\],” Barclays’ U.S. autos & mobility team wrote in the note early on Friday.

“Yet there were no updates indicating near-term opportunities. Tesla didn’t show its low-cost model planned for 1H′25 production,” they added. “We also didn’t get any near-term updates on FSD progress, or data reflecting improvement in the system.”

Piper Sandler analysts said in a separate Friday note that “most trading-oriented firms will be underwhelmed by the robo-taxi unveiling.”

“We wouldn’t be surprised if the stock sells off in the coming weeks, as pre-event momentum fizzles,” the investment bank’s analysts said in the note.

Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, suggested that Musk failed to make the case that Tesla is an AI company during the event. The bank’s analysts noted that Musk didn’t mention any details on improvements to Tesla’s FSD system, nor did the billionaire go into detail regarding rumored plans of a tie-up between Tesla and xAI, Musk’s AI company. Musk has previously denied such reports.

The event “overall disappointed expectations on a number of areas: a lack of data regarding rate-of-change on FSD/tech, ride-share economics and go-to-market strategy,” Morgan Stanley’s analysts wrote in a note Friday.

“We were overall disappointed with the substance and detail of the presentation. As such, we anticipate TSLA to be under pressure following the event,” they added.

It is expected to take some years still before self-driving cars become a mainstream reality on public roads, with regulators concerned over the safety features embedded into such vehicles.

Among the few companies that have successfully launched self-driving cars on public roads is Google’s Waymo, which has offered its robotaxi service to the general public since June."
Tesla asks shareholders to approve CEO Musk's 2018 pay voided by judge,2874,0.91,793,2024-04-17,"April 17 (Reuters) - Electric automaker Tesla (TSLA.O), opens new tab on Wednesday asked shareholders to ratify billionaire Elon Musk's compensation that was set in 2018 under the CEO pay package, just months after a Delaware judge rejected it.
The judge had tossed out Musk's record-breaking $56 billion pay in January, calling the compensation granted by the board ""an unfathomable sum"" that was unfair to shareholders.
Tesla also urged its investors to approve moving the company's state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas in a regulatory filing.

Shares of the world's most valuable automaker were up 1% before the bell.

Musk lays off Tesla senior executives,2631,0.93,685,2024-04-30,"Elon Musk has dismissed two Tesla senior executives and plans to lay off hundreds more employees, frustrated by falling sales and the pace of job cuts so far, The Information reported on Tuesday, citing the CEO’s email to senior managers.

Rebecca Tinucci, senior director of the electric vehicle maker’s Supercharger business, and Daniel Ho, head of the new vehicles program, will leave on Tuesday morning, the report said.

Musk also plans to dismiss everyone working for Tinucci and Ho, including the roughly 500 employees who work in the Supercharger group, The Information said. It was not clear how many employees worked for Ho.

Tesla’s public policy team, which was led by former executive Rohan Patel, will also be dissolved, the report said.

“Hopefully these actions are making it clear that we need to be absolutely hard core about headcount and cost reduction,” Musk wrote in the email, the report said. “While some on exec staff are taking this seriously, most are not yet doing so.”

Tesla, which had 140,473 employees globally as of end-2023, did not immediately respond to a Reuters’ request for comment.

Ho joined Tesla in 2013 and was a program manager in the development of the Model S, the 3, and the Y before being put in charge of all new vehicles, while Tinucci joined in 2018 as a senior product manager, according to their LinkedIn profiles.

Two other senior leaders — Patel and battery development chief Drew Baglino — announced their departures earlier this month, when Tesla also ordered the layoffs of more than 10% of its workforce.

Tesla is grappling with falling sales and an intensifying price war, which led to its quarterly revenue falling for the first time since 2020, the company reported last week.

Musk made progress towards rolling out Tesla’s advanced driver-assistance package in China, the epicenter of the EV price war, during a surprise visit to Beijing on Sunday.

That trip came just over a week after he scrapped a planned trip to India, where Tesla has long sought to start operations, due to “very heavy Tesla obligations.”

"Tesla down 33% ytd, just closed 162, market cap 517bil. Well's Fargo downgraded to 125.",2574,0.92,700,2024-03-14,"***On Fortune****:* 

""*Wall Street’s stance on Tesla Inc. worsened further on Wednesday as yet another analyst warned about risks to sales, and said its strategy of cutting prices to boost demand was losing its effectiveness.*  
*The electric vehicle maker’s growth in its core markets has moderated, Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan wrote in a note to clients Wednesday, as he downgraded the stock to the equivalent of a sell rating. Langan expects Tesla’s sales volumes to be flat this year and to fall in 2025.* 

*Elon Musk’s company is a “growth company with no growth,” Langan wrote. He highlighted that sales volumes rose only 3% in the second half of 2023 from the first half, while prices fell 5%.*  
  
*Tesla analysts are getting increasingly wary, and the share of bullish ratings on the stock has dropped to the lowest since April 2021. Sentiment deteriorated after the company in January said its growth will be “notably lower” this year, while other automakers, EV suppliers and even rental-car companies have sounded similarly cautious comments about the near-term demand for EVs.*  
  
*As a pure-play EV company with an eye-wateringly high valuation, Tesla shares have taken a serious hit. The stock has already fallen 29% this year through Tuesday’s close, placing it among the worst performers on the S&P 500 Index. The Austin-based company fell as much as 2.8% by 9:32 a.m. in New York.*  
  
*This year’s selloff has wiped more than $224 billion from the company’s market value through its last close, and pushed it off the list of the 10 biggest companies on the S&P 500.*   
  
*Even after the decline, the stock still trades at 55 times its forward earnings, compared to the average of about 31 for the Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Price Return Index.*   
  
*“While an EV and battery technology leader, Tesla screens poorly relative to Mag 7 peers,” Wells Fargo’s Langan said, noting the valuation discrepancy. The analyst lowered his 2024 profit estimate for the company to $2 a share from $2.40. That compares to analysts’ average expectation of $3.03 a share for the year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.*  
  
*Still, some analysts see a bright future for the company, and the drop in shares reflect an overly bearish outlook.*  


*“The demand story for EVs globally has clearly moderated, however we believe Tesla is on the broader trajectory to see growth and margin improvement return to the story over the coming quarters,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note Wednesday. “Now is not the time to throw in the towel on Tesla*.” 

***Ross Gerber on Yahoo finance***: ""*The original story that I think most investors bought into with Tesla didn't really include Elon and Twitter. And... for a long time, we all hoped that it really wouldn't affect Tesla and the demand for its products,"" Gerber says. ""We all know that that has now happened. The demand for Tesla products is obviously lower. They've had to discount and do many things that hurt margins and returns and, ultimately, profits for Tesla*.""

Elon Musk’s support for Trump pushes a corporate customer away from Tesla ,3526,0.85,190,2024-08-06,"European drugstore giant Rossmann announced Tuesday it will no longer buy Tesla’s electric vehicles for its fleet, effective immediately, citing CEO Elon Musk’s pro-Trump political support.

Rossmann, based in Germany, said in a statement that its decision was “based on the incompatibility between the statements of Tesla CEO Elon Musk and the values ​​that Tesla represents with its products.”

“Elon Musk makes no secret of his support for Donald Trump,” Raoul Rossmann, a spokesperson for the company, said in a statement. “Trump has repeatedly described climate change as a hoax - this attitude is in stark contrast to Tesla’s mission to contribute to environmental protection through the production of electric cars.”

While Rossmann only purchases about 180 electric vehicles a year — and only had 38 Teslas in its fleet according to Bloomberg — the company’s decision to cut all Tesla EV purchases shows that Musk’s political decisions have begun to impact the automaker well beyond the U.S.

Musk formally endorsed Trump last month, and said he was contributing funds to a pro-Trump group he helped create called America PAC. Musk is also slated to interview the former president, Trump announced on Tuesday.

During a debate with President Biden in June, former President Trump dodged questions about what he would do, if anything, to combat climate change. And Trump has called climate change a “hoax.” He has also promised to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate agreement, as he did during his presidency, if he is re-elected in November.

According to ongoing research by Morning Consult, Republicans in the U.S. began to view Musk more favorably following his leveraged buyout of Twitter (now known as X) in late 2022. However, this has not driven an increase in Republican’s “purchasing consideration” of electric vehicles here. According to Pew Research, Musk’s reputation with left-leaning voters has declined even though they are far more likely to purchase an EV.

Rossman’s decision follows a recent survey that found a deterioration in Tesla’s brand, attributed partly to Musk’s “antics” and “political rants.” While Tesla’s revenue increased 2% during the second quarter, automotive revenue dropped 7% to $19.9 billion from $21.27 billion in the same quarter a year ago.

Tesla opened a factory in 2022 in Brandenburg, Germany (outside of Berlin) and employs thousands in the country. At the end of 2023, the drugstore chain Rossmann reported that it had more than 4,700 stores and more than 60,000 employees with about half in Germany.

Tesla has faced protests by environmental activists in Germany who took issue with the company’s plans to cut down part of a forest and to use water for manufacturing in Brandenburg. Musk lashed out at protesters there, saying on X in March they’re “either the dumbest eco-terrorists on Earth or they’re puppets of those who don’t have good environmental goals.”

Tesla, Musk and representatives for Rossmann did not respond to requests for further details on Thursday morning.

Tesla faces a $7.5 billion ultimatum: Open up its charging network to rivals or be locked out...,5836,0.94,938,2023-02-13,"[Full Article](https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/news/tesla-faces-a-7-5-billion-ultimatum-open-up-its-charging-network-to-rivals-or-be-locked-out-of-biden-s-ev-subsidies-report-says/ar-AA17qumN?cvid=ba9b99dea7ee4da08fe347d443676af9)

 New US requirements will put Tesla under pressure to open up its EV charging network to rivals, per Reuters.

* If it doesn't, it could miss out on getting in on the $7.5 billion in charger subsidies planned by Biden.
* Tesla's 40,000+ EV chargers can only be used by its cars, but officials told Reuters that could change.

 

Tesla could find itself locked out of $7.5 billion in Biden administration subsidies if it fails to open its EV charging network up to competitors, according to a Reuters report.

The automaker's SuperCharger network has more stations in the US than any other charging company, but they can connnect only to plugs used by Tesla cars.

 ""We do understand that Tesla is looking to tweak their system to be more open access. So, if they do reach that point and meet those eligibility requirements, they certainly will be eligible for funding,"" Stuart Anderson, head of Iowa's transportation development division, told Reuters.

Tesla has already had a boost from the Biden administration's EV push in February, when the DOT tweaked its $7,500 tax credit consumer incentive plan to include more eligible models by expanding the definition of an SUV. That increased the potential demand for some of Tesla's models. 

Tesla CEO Elon Musk met with two White House officials last month to discuss ramping up EV production and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which includes the legislation on charging equipment.

Musk has spoken in the past about opening up the Supercharger network, but hasn't moved publicly to let others in. Tesla is dominant in chargers in the US, and it has a huge private network of more than 40,000 EV chargers globally."
"Tesla sells 1% of cars globally, yet is priced more than the companies combined that sell the other 99%",11482,0.84,2305,2021-11-04,"The valuation on Tesla is now beyond the absurd.  

Whilst European EV sales explode to presently 19% of all car sales this year, Tesla does not even make the top five EV sellers by company at a lowly 7%. (VW 25%; Stellantis 13%; Daimler 10%; BMW 10%; Hyundia-Kia 9%).

Tesla, unlike in the US, is simply being outsold by the vast array of alternative BEV models on sale particularly.  VW group alone offers the e-up, ID3 and ID4 (ID5 not yet on sale); Audi e-tron, e-tron Sportback e-tron GT and RS e-tron GT; Cupra Born; and Skoda Enyaq

In China Tesla has been pushed into 3rd place this year by BYD which has seen EV sales grow from 53K Q1; 98K.Q2; 183K Q3.  Tesla meanwhile has seen China quarterly sales for 2021 flattish at 69K, 62K and 75K.  China will likely sell 3 million EV's this year, half the worlds volume and Tesla sales are flat for the year.  Tesla might sell a lowly 9%.

Tesla dominates the US markets of course, where few EV models are on sale.  EV sales might be 3% of automotive sales.

Whilst investors will assert these stats do not.matter and Tesla's valuation is all about  tech, batteries and robo-taxis, it still does not sell any car related tech beyond its own cars.  Take up of FSD is a lowly 11%.  It still buys it's battery cells.  By its own statements it has a level 2/3 driver assist whilst companies like Waymo are already starting to offer level 4/5 robo-taxis in cities like San Fran (a free trial program has commenced).

With Tesla slipping badly in the two biggest and mature EV markets globally, it's EV mkt share has fallen from near 18% highs in 2019 to 14.7% YTD in 2021.  With Europe and China likely to see 20% EV sales, the Tesla domination of global car mkts story is looking utterly flawed, yet its market capitalisation is now than the entire companies combined that sell 99% of cars and are adding EV's faster.

Tesla is frankly trading at utterly ludicrous levels given the clear reality of global EV market growth.

Tesla net income and earnings drop more than 20% from last year,3459,0.94,870,2023-04-19,"Tesla reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.

Earnings per share: 85 cents adj. vs 85 cents expected, according to the average analyst estimate compiled by Refinitiv

Revenue: $23.33 billion vs $23.21 billion expected, according to Refinitiv estimates

Net income came in at $2.51 billion, down 24% from last year, while GAAP earnings came in at $0.73, down 23% from the year-ago quarter.

Automotive revenue, Tesla’s core segment, reached $19.96 billion in the quarter.

Tesla’s first-quarter earnings call will be livestreamed via Twitter, a first for the electric vehicle maker. CEO Elon Musk sold billions of dollars worth of his Tesla holdings in 2022 to finance a $44 billion buyout of the social media company, where he is now also CEO.

The company cut prices on its vehicles at the end of last year and into the first quarter of 2023, including additional cuts Tuesday night. At the same time, Tesla is charting ambitious plans for expansion and increased capital expenditures.

Revenue in the quarter likely increased 24% from $18.76 billion a year earlier, according to Refinitiv estimates.

Tesla currently sells four EV models, which are produced at two vehicle assembly plants in the U.S., one in Shanghai and another outside of Berlin.


Shareholders who submitted questions ahead of the earnings call for management’s consideration were seeking updates on the company’s trapezoidal, sci-fi inspired Cybertruck, the company’s energy division, and the timing for a new model vehicle from Tesla.

In early April, Tesla reported vehicle deliveries of 422,875 vehicles in the first quarter, the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the company. Production was slightly higher than deliveries for the first three months of 2023 at 440,808 vehicles.

A month earlier, Musk announced plans to build a Tesla factory in Monterrey, Mexico, a day’s drive from a relatively new factory in Austin, Texas. And more recently, Tesla said it plans to set up a factory to make Megapacks, or large lithium ion battery-based energy storage systems, in Shanghai.

According to a financial filing published in late January, Tesla expected to spend between $7 billion and $9 billion in 2024 and 2025, an increase in capital expenditures of about $1 billion in the next two years.

Tesla shares have rebounded this year from a dismal 2022, when they lost about two-thirds of their value alongside a plunge in tech companies. The stock is up 48% in 2023.

Images of chat discussion between Elon Musk and Bill Gates regarding ""philanthropy on climate change"" have been leaked. Elon confirmed their authenticity on Twitter by saying: 

""Yeah, but I didn’t leak it to NYT. They must have got it through friends of friends. I heard from multiple people at TED that Gates still had half billion short against Tesla, which is why I asked him, so it’s not exactly top secret.""

Also over the last year, anyone betting against the FAANG+M stocks would have been decimated.

So why is the Popular Meme stock so important? If Apple market cap goes down 1 percent it probably same loss as the shorts had against the popular stock.

*When Reuters reported in April that Tesla had scrapped plans for a long-promised, next-generation $25,000 electric vehicle, the automaker’s stock plunged. Chief Executive Elon Musk rushed to respond on X, his social-media network.*  
*“Reuters is lying,” he posted, without elaborating. Tesla’s stock recovered some of its losses.*  
*Six months later, Musk appears to have backed into an admission that Tesla dropped its plans for a human-driven $25,000 car. He said in an Oct. 23 earnings call that building the affordable EV would be ""pointless” unless the car was fully autonomous.*  
*His latest remarks came in response to an investor asking: “When can we expect Tesla to give us the $25,000 non-robotaxi regular car model?”*  
*Musk responded: “We’re not making a non-robo…,” before he was interrupted by another Tesla executive. Musk later added: “Basically, I think having a regular $25K model is pointless. It would be silly.”*  
*The April 5 Reuters article reported that Tesla had abandoned plans for an all-new, affordable mass-market EV but still planned a self-driving robotaxi. Since then, Musk has increasingly touted plans for robotaxis and autonomous vehicles.*  
*Tesla and Musk did not respond to requests for comment for this story.*  
*On the October earnings call, Musk said that Tesla does plan a “$25K car” – its “Cybercab,” a two-door, two-seat, fully autonomous vehicle. Musk unveiled a prototype at a Hollywood-style event on Oct. 10.*  
*Musk says Tesla will start production of the Cybercab in 2026, after it deploys fully autonomous versions of its current Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in Texas and California next year. The automaker faces steep technological, regulatory and legal challenges in delivering on Musk’s latest promises of fully autonomous vehicles, which echo others dating back about a decade.*  
*An all-new affordable Tesla for human drivers had until recently been a linchpin of Tesla’s strategy to become the world’s biggest automaker. For several years, Tesla had a goal of producing 20 million vehicles a year by 2030, more than tenfold what it sells now and nearly double that of Toyota, the current global sales leader. In May, Tesla dropped the 20-million goal from its latest “impact report” on progress toward sustainability goals.*  
*As recently as January of this year, Musk confirmed the plan for an all-new affordable EV in an earnings call. He said the next-generation vehicle would arrive in 2025 and launch a second major ""growth wave,” following the first wave with the release of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in 2017 and 2020, respectively.*  
*Investors and Tesla fans commonly called the anticipated cheap car a “Model 2,” slotting in below the Model 3, currently the least-expensive Tesla, starting at $42,490.*  
*In January, Musk described the all-new model as requiring “new revolutionary manufacturing technology.” But in April, after Reuters reported Tesla had scrapped the Model 2, Musk outlined a plan for “more affordable” models that could be produced “on the same manufacturing lines” as current Teslas.*  
*Seth Goldstein, a Morningstar Research Services analyst, said he believes these less-expensive vehicles will be built on current Tesla platforms and priced in the mid-$30,000s.*  
*“It was my understanding that the original plan was to make the more-affordable vehicle on a new platform,” he told Reuters. “I think Tesla realized they were late to making an affordable vehicle versus their Chinese-EV peers … So, they changed their strategy rather than make a large investment to produce a new vehicle.”*  
*After the April 5 Reuters report that Tesla had killed the Model 2, Musk posted that day on X saying Tesla planned a “robotaxi unveil” in August. The event, delayed until October and held on a movie set near Los Angeles, underwhelmed Wall Street and drove a 9% drop in Tesla shares the following day.*  
*Some investors viewed Musk’s comments on the Cybercab – along with displays of an autonomous “Robovan” concept and humanoid robots – as short on concrete details about the products. Tesla hasn’t said whether the Cybercab will feature new self-driving technology beyond the company’s “Full Self-Driving” feature in its current vehicles. Its existing models can’t fully drive themselves and require a human driver paying strict attention.*  
*The target market for the Cybercab isn’t clear. The Cybercab’s sports-car looks and two-door, two-seat configuration – a nearly extinct layout in the wider U.S. auto market – puzzled some analysts who expected a robotaxi with more room for passengers and luggage.*  
*Musk, in the October earnings call, said the concept vehicle’s design was “optimized for autonomy” and would also deliver affordability.*  
*“It will cost … roughly 25K, so it is a 25K car,” Musk said. “It just won't have a steering wheel and pedals.”*"
Tesla is Completely out of Touch with Needs of Taxi Services. ,778,0.8,435,2024-10-11,"Seeing a lot of focus on the Temu Boston Dynamics bot, but not a lot of discussion on the robo taxi. 

How this thing is built tells me how out of touch and unprepared Tesla is to seriously compete in ride servicing. 

First off this thing has two seats, that alone is such a dumb design decision. It had to be Elon that said to keep it as two seats so it looks futuristic and aesthetic. What if I want to travel with a small group of people? I’m not using the LAX shuttle van at that point, I’m immediately turning to a competitor. Haven’t really seen anyone comment on how out of touch and unnecessary that was. 

One other concern I have is how Tesla primarily uses cameras. What if there are sirens and a fire truck, ambulance, or police car is blowing through an intersection. Other autonomous vehicles incorporate sound, I’m not too sure Tesla does. If not it sounds like a lawsuit waiting to happen. 

Beyond this there’s the ridiculous price tag he put on it which it’ll probably be nowhere close to. 

What are other people’s thoughts on this, did anything with this Robotaxi actually look like a feasible product to you? It looks like an aesthetic toy, but not an actual product that can compete in the space. Based on my understanding of a typical car design cycle, redesigning this to add four instead of just 2 seats would take probably another 2-4 years at least. To me it seems like they really just showed they lost on their biggest bet in the near future. 


Edit: Alright read through the comments, and still think the 2 seat no steering wheel design is stupid. People are saying this is meant to also be a personal commuter car. So my choices are to buy a 30K Robotaxi (knowing Tesla’s history this WILL be priced higher) and then ALSO get a model 3 or model Y to drive around my family for ANOTHER 40K when I can just get ONE model 3 or any other self driving car, no Robotaxi and do everything I need? How is that budget friendly at all, and if there’s a nicer car with a steering wheel that self drives why would I buy something without the option of a steering wheel? 
Still a toy.
 
Also, if it’s for personal use, how does this know where to park at my office or how to get past a security gate to private property? If I live in a condo building with a garage how does it know how to get out of the parking garage and where my parking space is? It makes no sense as a personal car for a LOT of people.

And even if the majority of taxi rides are 1-2 people, why not just use a model 3 that’s 10K more, already exists, and can service that additional 15-20% of your taxi market (given the Robotaxi is definitely not gonna cost 30K and over the life of the car the extra seats pay for themselves). You also save on all the costs that it took to make a stupid 2 seater when it came to expanding production lines/capacity, testing, and designing the pointless thing. 

My opinion doesn’t change this thing shouldn’t exist, and it’s out of touch with what most people need. Total waste of time when they could’ve focused on actually competing with growing competition in the normal car space where they’re losing their competitive advantage. There’s a reason why Uber and the ex-Waymo CEO were not impressed."

"Tesla reports 386,810 deliveries in the first quarter of 2024, produced 433,371 vehicles ",1131,0.9,692,2024-04-02,"Tesla just published its first-quarter vehicle production and deliveries report for 2024. Here are the key numbers:

Total deliveries Q1 2024: 386,810
Total production Q1 2024: 433,371

Tesla doesn’t break out sales of its vehicles by model but reported that it produced 412,376 Model 3/Y cars and delivered 369,783 of those cars. It produced 20,995 of its other models and delivered 17,027.

In the same period last year, the electric automaker reported 422,875 deliveries and production of 440,808 vehicles. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Tesla reported 484,507 deliveries and production of 494,989 vehicles.

Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla but are not precisely defined in the company’s shareholder communications.

According to a mean of 11 estimates compiled by FactSet, analysts were expecting deliveries of around 457,000 for the period ending March 31. Estimates ranged from a high of 511,000 deliveries to a low of 414,000 for the first quarter, with estimates updated in March ranging from 414,000 to 469,000 deliveries.

Independent auto industry researcher Troy Teslike, whose work is closely followed by Tesla fans, had expected deliveries to come in around 409,000.

Tesla’s head of investor relations Martin Viecha sent around a company-compiled consensus based on 30 analysts’ estimates over the weekend to select investors. The consensus, which was viewed by CNBC, said analysts were expecting a mean of 443,027 deliveries and a median of 431,125 deliveries for the quarter.

Tesla faced numerous challenges in the first quarter.

Houthi militia attacks on shippers in the Red Sea disrupted Tesla’s component supply and temporarily suspended production at its German factory outside of Berlin in January. In March, environmental activists set fire to infrastructure near that same factory, depriving Tesla of sufficient operation power and again causing a pause in production.

In China, Tesla faced an onslaught of competition from domestic EV makers, including BYD and newcomers such as the phone maker Xiaomi. After sluggish sales numbers for its China-made cars in January and February, Tesla reduced production of its Model 3 and Model Y at its Shanghai plant and slashed workers’ schedules to 5 days a week from 6 and a half days.

In the U.S., reviews were mixed for Tesla’s newest model — an angular pickup dubbed the Cybertruck — which the EV maker only began to sell in small numbers in December last year.

A series of discounts and incentives appeared to be less effective in driving sales volume than in the past for Tesla.

During the final days of the first quarter, Tesla CEO Elon Musk mandated that all sales and service staff install and demo the newest version of the company’s premium driver assistance system for customers in North America before handing over their cars. The system is marketed as Full Self-Driving but doesn’t make Tesla cars autonomous. They require a human at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.

Shares of Tesla dropped 29% in the first quarter, the biggest decline since the end of 2022 and the third-steepest quarterly plunge since the company’s IPO in 2010.

Tesla cut prices in the United States between 2% and nearly 6%, its website showed on Thursday, as the company extends a discount drive on its electric vehicles that analysts caution could hurt profitability. The fifth such cut in Tesla’s largest market since the start of the year comes as the United States prepares to adopt tougher standards this month that are expected to limit EV tax credits. Tesla cut prices on both versions of its Model 3 sedan by $1,000 and on its Model Y crossover by $2,000, the website showed. It also cut prices on both versions of its more expensive Model S and Model X by $5,000. The company has said the tougher U.S. standards would reduce the $7,500 tax credit available for its base, rear-wheel drive Model 3 since January.

Some analysts who expected the further price cuts had flagged concern that Tesla’s industry-leading profit margins could be at risk. This week Tesla reported first-quarter deliveries of almost 423,000 vehicles, up just 4% from the prior quarter after price cuts in the United States, China and other markets aiming to spur demand. Tesla has set a target of 1.8 million deliveries this year. Tesla has cut the price of its base Model 3 by a cumulative 11% since the start of the year, with a 20% reduction on its base Model Y."
Tesla investor Ross Gerber says he's been dumping the stock because no one wants the company's cars or robots,817,0.87,438,2024-08-27,"* Tesla stock is in a ""quagmire,"" the longtime investor Ross Gerber has said.
* He said he'd sold about $60 million in Tesla shares amid growing concerns over the carmaker.
* Gerber told Yahoo Finance that no one seemed interested in buying Tesla's cars anymore.

  
One of Tesla's longtime investors has dumped about half his stake in Elon Musk's carmaker.



The shareholder, Ross Gerber, has said that's because no one seems interested in buying Tesla's cars or robots.



Gerber, who's been a loud critic of Musk since the Tesla CEO acquired Twitter in 2022, said he had sold about 60 million worth of his Tesla shares. He told Yahoo Finance in a recent interview that his investment fund still had a $50 million stake in the company.



""Over time, I've just been sort of lowering my position, because I just don't have the same confidence that they're going to achieve the goals that were set out for Tesla several years ago and even recently, which is really to sell more cars,"" Gerber said, dismissing bullish talk on Tesla's robotics and full-self-driving tech. ""That's just a distraction from the fact that they need to sell cars, this year, and next year, and the year after, because none of this is coming anytime soon,"" he added.



Other Tesla investors have also grown skeptical and impatient over the car company's trajectory. Tesla's stock is down 13% this year, largely because of declining sales, rising competition in China, and drama surrounding Musk's legal battles.



Gerber said the used-car market was swarmed with old Teslas, adding that he'd been unable to offload his own Tesla at what he deemed a fair value.



""It's really a quagmire where you have the best products in an industry but a CEO who doesn't actually work there, who doesn't try to sell the cars,"" Gerber said, adding: ""We've seen sales go down, and that's what's happening. Sales are going down. If you're expecting a great quarter, you're wrong. They're not selling any Teslas here, other than basically, discount, discount, discount.""



And while analysts have made the case that the company is being undervalued as an AI firm, Gerber said artificial intelligence was unlikely to save the company. He speculated that demand would be poor for Tesla's humanoid robots, given doubts over Musk amid his chaotic revamp of Twitter into X.



""The simplest way to do it is, go around to your neighbors and ask them, 'How many of you would buy a humanoid robot built by Elon Musk?' And the answer is zero, OK. Nobody wants a robot from Elon Musk. Why? Who would trust it?"" Gerber said, adding: ""The last thing I need is some robot built by Elon Musk in my house, so I don't know if they thought about the marketing of this at all yet.""



Musk's leadership of Tesla has been under rising scrutiny from investors and lawmakers over the past few years. Most recently, Sen. Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to Tesla's board of directors, calling on the executives to ensure Musk was meeting his financial responsibilities to Tesla shareholders.

"California plan excludes Tesla from new EV tax credits, governor's office says",694,0.82,291,2024-11-25,"Tesla's electric vehicles likely would not qualify for California's new state tax credits under a proposal in the works if President-elect Donald Trump scraps the federal tax credit for EV purchases, Governor Gavin Newsom's office said on Monday.
Tesla shares closed down 4%.

Trump's transition team is considering eliminating the federal tax credit of $7,500 for EV purchases, Reuters reported this month.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a close Trump adviser, sharply criticized the idea of barring the automaker from EV subsidies writing on X in response ""Even though Tesla is the only company who manufactures their EVs in California! This is insane.""

Musk has said he supports ending subsidies for EVs, oil and gas.

Newsom said on Monday that if Trump eliminates a federal EV tax credit, he will propose creating a new version of the state’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program that ended in 2023 and spent $1.49 billion to subsidize more than 594,000 vehicles.

""The governor’s proposal for ZEV rebates, and any potential market cap, is subject to negotiation with the legislature. Any potential market cap would be intended to foster market competition, innovation and to support new market entrants,"" the office said.

California provided up to $7,500 for the purchase or lease of a new plug-in hybrid, battery or fuel cell EV and could potentially be paid for by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund which is funded by polluters under the state's cap-and-trade program.

Musk and Newsom have clashed over state policies such as shutting Tesla's Fremont factory during the pandemic and California's approval of a bill on transgender kids.

In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from California to Texas, and Musk said this year that his other companies such as SpaceX and social media platform X will follow suit.

California has crossed the 2 million mark for sales of zero-emission vehicles, doubling total sales since 2022.

Last month, a California official said he expects the Environmental Protection Agency to approve the state's plan to halt the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035, a proposal that major automakers have met with skepticism.
California's rules, which have been adopted by a dozen other states, require 80% of all new vehicles sold in the state be electric by 2035 and no more than 20% plug-in hybrid electric.

"Tesla reports 443,956 deliveries in second quarter, a 4.8% decrease from last year ",1001,0.93,424,2024-07-02,"Tesla just posted its second-quarter vehicle production and deliveries numbers for 2024.

Here are the key numbers:

Total deliveries Q2 2024: 443,956 vehicles

Total production Q2 2024: 410,831 vehicles

Tesla’s numbers beat Wall Street estimates. Analysts expected Tesla deliveries to hit 439,000 in the three months ending June 30, according to a consensus of estimates compiled by FactSet Street Account. The total number of deliveries in the second quarter was down 4.8% from 466,140 a year earlier.

Troy Teslike, an independent researcher widely followed by Tesla fans, predicted deliveries of 423,000 for the quarter.

Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the electric vehicle maker. Tesla groups deliveries into two categories — Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, and all other vehicles — but doesn’t report numbers for individual models or specific regions.

Tesla’s current lineup includes its popular Model Y crossover utility vehicles, Model 3 sedans and the new Cybertruck pickups, as well as the Model X SUV and flagship Model S sedan.

In April, Tesla reported a drop of 8.5% in first-quarter deliveries to 386,810, the first annual decline since 2020. Weeks later the company reported 13% decline in year-over-year revenue for the quarter, “primarily due to lower average selling price.”

Sluggish sales were in part the result of temporary factory shut downs initiated in response to an alleged arson attack at Tesla’s factory in Germany, as well as shipping delays following Red Sea conflicts, Tesla said.

But the sales drop also correlated with Tesla’s aging lineup of vehicles, increased competition from other EV makers especially in China, and brand erosion that one recent survey attributed partly to CEO Elon Musk’s “antics” and “political rants.”

Tesla shares are down 16% in 2024 even after rallying 6% on Monday.

Tesla has offered a range of discounts and other incentives this year to try spur sales.

In China, Tesla is currently offering a zero-interest loan as an incentive to get customers to buy a Model 3 or Model Y by July 31. According to its 2023 annual filing, Tesla generated about $21.75 billion of its overall revenue from China, representing 22.5% of total sales.

Colin Langan, an analyst at Wells Fargo, issued a report on Monday, saying the firm sees “declining delivery growth driven by lower demand & diminished return on price cuts.” He recommends selling Tesla shares.

Wells Fargo expects automotive gross margins at Tesla, not including environmental credits, to fall given the “likelihood of more price cuts & lower volumes” as the year continues.

Investor focus will now shift to Tesla’s second-quarter earnings report later this month, and a separate marketing event planned for August, when the company intends to reveal its design for a dedicated robotaxi or “CyberCab.”

Elon Musk says Tesla will unveil its robotaxi on Aug. 8; shares pop,991,0.79,734,2024-04-05,"Tesla will reveal its robotaxi product on Aug. 8, CEO Elon Musk said in a social media post on X.

Musk has spoken about the robotaxi project for years, and it could represent a major new business for the carmaker as investors grow wary of the company during a period of slowing growth.

Tesla shares rose over 3% in extended trading after Musk’s tweet.

Musk shared the release date on Friday after Reuters reported that plans for Tesla’s highly anticipated low-cost car model had been scrapped. Musk accused Reuters of “lying.”

Tesla’s robotaxi project, according to Musk’s past remarks, would allow Tesla vehicles to use self-driving technology to autonomously pick up riders for fares. In 2019, Musk said that he expected to have over 1 million robotaxis on the road by 2020. Author Walter Isaacson also mentioned the robotaxi project in his biography of Musk, published in 2022.

Currently, Tesla offers advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS,) including its Autopilot option, as well as a premium Full Self-Driving “FSD” option, which costs $199 per month for subscribers. However, Teslas currently cannot operate without human intervention.

There is significant competition in the market for taxi services that use self-driving cars.

Alphabet’s autonomous vehicle unit Waymo operates driverless ride-hailing services in Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles, and is now ramping up in Tesla’s home base of Austin, Texas.

GM’s Cruise service previously offered self-driving car services in San Francisco before being wound down under regulatory scrutiny after an accident. Since the incident, Cruise’s robotaxi fleet has been grounded, local and federal governments have launched their own investigations and Cruise leadership has been gutted.

Source: Tesla rigged the dashboard to overstate battery range; created a “Diversion Team” to suppress thousands of complaints,2369,0.91,491,2023-07-27,"In March, Alexandre Ponsin set out on a family road trip from Colorado to California in his newly purchased Tesla, a used 2021 Model 3. He expected to get something close to the electric sport sedan’s advertised driving range: 353 miles on a fully charged battery.

He soon realized he was sometimes getting less than half that much range, particularly in cold weather – such severe underperformance that he was convinced the car had a serious defect.

“We’re looking at the range, and you literally see the number decrease in front of your eyes,” he said of his dashboard range meter.

Ponsin contacted Tesla and booked a service appointment in California. He later received two text messages, telling him that “remote diagnostics” had determined his battery was fine, and then: “We would like to cancel your visit.”

What Ponsin didn’t know was that Tesla employees had been instructed to thwart any customers complaining about poor driving range from bringing their vehicles in for service. Last summer, the company quietly created a “Diversion Team” in Las Vegas to cancel as many range-related appointments as possible.

The Austin, Texas-based electric carmaker deployed the team because its service centers were inundated with appointments from owners who had expected better performance based on the company’s advertised estimates and the projections displayed by the in-dash range meters of the cars themselves, according to several people familiar with the matter.


 A Tesla logo shown outside a Beijing showroom. The automaker’s estimates of its electric vehicles’ driving range have been among the most aggressive in the industry. It has faced thousands of complaints from customers disappointed by the vehicles’ real-world performance. REUTERS/Thomas Peter
Inside the Nevada team’s office, some employees celebrated canceling service appointments by putting their phones on mute and striking a metal xylophone, triggering applause from coworkers who sometimes stood on desks. The team often closed hundreds of cases a week and staffers were tracked on their average number of diverted appointments per day.

Managers told the employees that they were saving Tesla about $1,000 for every canceled appointment, the people said. Another goal was to ease the pressure on service centers, some of which had long waits for appointments.

In most cases, the complaining customers’ cars likely did not need repair, according to the people familiar with the matter. Rather, Tesla created the groundswell of complaints another way – by hyping the range of its futuristic electric vehicles, or EVs, raising consumer expectations beyond what the cars can deliver. Teslas often fail to achieve their advertised range estimates and the projections provided by the cars’ own equipment, according to Reuters interviews with three automotive experts who have tested or studied the company’s vehicles.

Neither Tesla nor Chief Executive Elon Musk responded to detailed questions from Reuters for this story.

Reuters reporter Steve Stecklow discusses how Tesla has been exaggerating the driving range of its vehicles for years.
Tesla years ago began exaggerating its vehicles’ potential driving distance – by rigging their range-estimating software. The company decided about a decade ago, for marketing purposes, to write algorithms for its range meter that would show drivers “rosy” projections for the distance it could travel on a full battery, according to a person familiar with an early design of the software for its in-dash readouts.

Then, when the battery fell below 50% of its maximum charge, the algorithm would show drivers more realistic projections for their remaining driving range, this person said. To prevent drivers from getting stranded as their predicted range started declining more quickly, Teslas were designed with a “safety buffer,” allowing about 15 miles (24 km) of additional range even after the dash readout showed an empty battery, the source said.

The directive to present the optimistic range estimates came from Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, this person said.

“Elon wanted to show good range numbers when fully charged,” the person said, adding: “When you buy a car off the lot seeing 350-mile, 400-mile range, it makes you feel good.”

Tesla’s intentional inflation of in-dash range-meter projections and the creation of its range-complaints diversion team have not been previously reported.

Driving range is among the most important factors in consumer decisions on which electric car to buy, or whether to buy one at all. So-called range anxiety – the fear of running out of power before reaching a charger – has been a primary obstacle to boosting electric-vehicle sales.

At the time Tesla programmed in the rosy range projections, it was selling only two models: the two-door Roadster, its first vehicle, which was later discontinued; and the Model S, a luxury sport sedan launched in 2012. It now sells four models: two cars, the 3 and S; and two crossover SUVs, the X and Y. Tesla plans the return of the Roadster, along with a “Cybertruck” pickup.

Reuters could not determine whether Tesla still uses algorithms that boost in-dash range estimates. But automotive testers and regulators continue to flag the company for exaggerating the distance its vehicles can travel before their batteries run out.

Tesla was fined earlier this year by South Korean regulators who found the cars delivered as little as half their advertised range in cold weather. Another recent study found that three Tesla models averaged 26% below their advertised ranges.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has required Tesla since the 2020 model year to reduce the range estimates the automaker wanted to advertise for six of its vehicles by an average of 3%. The EPA told Reuters, however, that it expects some variation between the results of separate tests conducted by automakers and the agency.

Data collected in 2022 and 2023 from more than 8,000 Teslas by Recurrent, a Seattle-based EV analytics company, showed that the cars’ dashboard range meters didn’t change their estimates to reflect hot or cold outside temperatures, which can greatly reduce range.

Recurrent found that Tesla’s four models almost always calculated that they could travel more than 90% of their advertised EPA range estimates regardless of external temperatures. Scott Case, Recurrent’s chief executive, told Reuters that Tesla’s range meters also ignore many other conditions affecting driving distance.

Electric cars can lose driving range for a lot of the same reasons as gasoline cars — but to a greater degree. The cold is a particular drag on EVs, slowing the chemical and physical reactions inside their batteries and requiring a heating system to protect them. Other drains on the battery include hilly terrain, headwinds, a driver’s lead foot and running the heating or air-conditioning inside the cabin.

Tesla discusses the general effect of such conditions in a “Range Tips” section of its website. The automaker also recently updated its vehicle software to provide a breakdown of battery consumption during recent trips with suggestions on how range might have been improved.

Tesla vehicles provide range estimates in two ways: One through a dashboard meter of current range that’s always on, and a second projection through its navigation system, which works when a driver inputs a specific destination. The navigation system’s range estimate, Case said, does account for a wider set of conditions, including temperature. While those estimates are “more realistic,” they still tend to overstate the distance the car can travel before it needs to be recharged, he said.

Recurrent tested other automakers’ in-dash range meters –  including the Ford Mustang Mach-E, the Chevrolet Bolt and the Hyundai Kona – and found them to be more accurate. The Kona’s range meter generally underestimated the distance the car could travel, the tests showed. Recurrent conducted the study with the help of a National Science Foundation grant.

Tesla, Case said, has consistently designed the range meters in its cars to deliver aggressive rather than conservative estimates: “That’s where Tesla has taken a different path from most other automakers.”

Failed tests and false advertising

Tesla isn’t the only automaker with cars that don’t regularly achieve their advertised ranges.

One of the experts, Gregory Pannone, co-authored a study of 21 different brands of electric vehicles, published in April by SAE International, an engineering organization. The research found that, on average, the cars fell short of their advertised ranges by 12.5% in highway driving.

The study did not name the brands tested, but Pannone told Reuters that three Tesla models posted the worst performance, falling short of their advertised ranges by an average of 26%.

The EV pioneer pushes the limits of government testing regulations that govern the claims automakers put on window stickers, the three automotive experts told Reuters.

Like their gas-powered counterparts, new electric vehicles are required by U.S. federal law to display a label with fuel-efficiency information. In the case of EVs, this is stated in miles-per-gallon equivalent (MPGe), allowing consumers to compare them to gasoline or diesel vehicles. The labels also include estimates of total range: how far an EV can travel on a full charge, in combined city and highway driving.

“They've gotten really good at exploiting the rule book and maximizing certain points to work in their favor involving EPA tests.”

EV makers have a choice in how to calculate a model’s range. They can use a standard EPA formula that converts fuel-economy results from city and highway driving tests to calculate a total range figure. Or automakers can conduct additional tests to come up with their own range estimate. The only reason to conduct more tests is to generate a more favorable estimate, said Pannone, a retired auto-industry veteran.

Tesla conducts additional range tests on all of its models. By contrast, many other automakers, including Ford, Mercedes and Porsche, continue to rely on the EPA’s formula to calculate potential range, according to agency data for 2023 models. That generally produces more conservative estimates, Pannone said.

Mercedes-Benz told Reuters it uses the EPA’s formula because it believes it provides a more accurate estimate. “We follow a certification strategy that reflects the real-world driving behavior of our customers in the best possible way,” the German carmaker said in a statement.

Ford and Porsche didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Whatever an automaker decides, the EPA must approve the window-sticker numbers. The agency told Reuters it conducts its own tests on 15% to 20% of new electric vehicles each year as part of an audit program and has tested six Tesla models since the 2020 model year.

EPA data obtained by Reuters through the Freedom of Information Act showed that the audits resulted in Tesla being required to lower all the cars’ estimated ranges by an average of 3%. The projected range for one vehicle, the 2021 Model Y Long Range AWD (all-wheel drive), dropped by 5.15%. The EPA said all the changes to Tesla’s range estimates were made before the company used the figures on window stickers.

The EPA said it has seen “everything” in its audits of EV manufacturers’ range testing, including low and high estimates from other automakers. “That is what we expect when we have new manufacturers and new technologies entering the market  and why EPA prioritizes” auditing them, the agency said.

The EPA cautioned that individuals’ actual experience with vehicle efficiency might differ from the estimates the agency approves. Independent automotive testers commonly examine the EPA-approved fuel-efficiency or driving range claims against their own experience in structured tests or real-world driving. Often, they get different results, as in the case of Tesla vehicles.

Pannone called Tesla “the most aggressive” electric-vehicle manufacturer when it comes to range calculations.

“I’m not suggesting they’re cheating,” Pannone said of Tesla. “What they’re doing, at least minimally, is leveraging the current procedures more than the other manufacturers.”

Jonathan Elfalan, vehicle testing director for the automotive website Edmunds.com, reached a similar conclusion to Pannone after an extensive examination of vehicles from Tesla and other major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, Hyundai and Porsche.

All five Tesla models tested by Edmunds failed to achieve their advertised range, the website reported in February 2021. All but one of 10 other models from other manufacturers exceeded their advertised range.

Tesla complained to Edmunds that the test failed to account for the safety buffer programmed into Tesla’s in-dash range meters. So Edmunds did further testing, this time running the vehicles, as Tesla requested, past the point where their range meters indicated the batteries had run out.

Only two of six Teslas tested matched their advertised range, Edmunds reported in March 2021. The tests found no fixed safety buffer.

Edmunds has continued to test electric vehicles, using its own standard method, to see if they meet their advertised range estimates. As of July, no Tesla vehicle had, Elfalan said.

“They've gotten really good at exploiting the rule book and maximizing certain points to work in their favor involving EPA tests,” Elfalan told Reuters. The practice can “misrepresent what their customers will experience with their vehicles.”

South Korean regulators earlier this year fined Tesla about $2.1 million for falsely advertised driving ranges on its local website between August 2019 and December 2022. The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) found that Tesla failed to tell customers that cold weather can drastically reduce its cars’ range. It cited tests by the country’s environment ministry that showed Tesla cars lost up to 50.5% of the company’s claimed ranges in cold weather.

The KFTC also flagged certain statements on Tesla’s website, including one that claimed about a particular model: “You can drive 528 km (328 miles) or longer on a single charge.” Regulators required Tesla to remove the “or longer” phrase.

Korean regulators required Tesla to publicly admit it had misled consumers. Musk and two local executives did so in a June 19 statement, acknowledging “false/exaggerated advertising.”

Creating a diversion

By last year, sales of Tesla’s electric vehicles were surging. The company delivered about 1.3 million cars in 2022, nearly 13 times more than five years before.

As sales grew, so did demand for service appointments. The wait for an available booking was sometimes a month, according to one of the sources familiar with the diversion team’s operations.

Tesla instructs owners to book appointments through a phone app. The company found that many problems could be handled by its “virtual” service teams, who can remotely diagnose and fix various issues.

Tesla supervisors told some virtual team members to steer customers away from bringing their cars into service whenever possible. One current Tesla “Virtual Service Advisor” described part of his job in his LinkedIn profile: “Divert customers who do not require in person service.”

Such advisors handled a variety of issues, including range complaints. But last summer, Tesla created the Las Vegas “Diversion Team” to handle only range cases, according to the people familiar with the matter.

The office atmosphere at times resembled that of a telemarketing boiler room. A supervisor had purchased the metallophone – a xylophone with metal keys – that employees struck to celebrate appointment cancellations, according to the people familiar with the office’s operations.

Advisers would normally run remote diagnostics on customers’ cars and try to call them, the people said. They were trained to tell customers that the EPA-approved range estimates were just a prediction, not an actual measurement, and that batteries degrade over time, which can reduce range. Advisors would offer tips on extending range by changing driving habits.

If the remote diagnostics found anything else wrong with the vehicle that was not related to driving range, advisors were instructed not to tell the customer, one of the sources said. Managers told them to close the cases.

Tesla also updated its phone app so that any customer who complained about range could no longer book service appointments, one of the sources said. Instead, they could request that someone from Tesla contact them. It often took several days before owners were contacted because of the large backlog of range complaints, the source said.


Tesla recently stopped owners from using its app to book service appointments relating to complaints about driving range. Instead, it gave them tips on increasing range and directed their inquiries to a “Diversion Team” tasked with preventing service-center visits.
The update routed all U.S. range complaints to the Nevada diversion team, which started in Las Vegas and later moved to the nearby suburb of Henderson. The team was soon fielding up to 2,000 cases a week, which sometimes included multiple complaints from customers frustrated they couldn't book a service appointment, one of the people said.

The team was expected to close about 750 cases a week. To accomplish that, office supervisors told advisers to call a customer once and, if there was no answer, to close the case as unresponsive, the source said. When customers did respond, advisers were told to try to complete the call in no more than five minutes.

In late 2022, managers aiming to quickly close cases told advisors to stop running remote diagnostic tests on the vehicles of owners who had reported range problems, according to one of the people familiar with the diversion team’s operations.

“Thousands of customers were told there is nothing wrong with their car” by advisors who had never run diagnostics, the person said.

Reuters could not establish how long the practice continued.

Tesla recently stopped using its diversion team in Nevada to handle range-related complaints, according to the person familiar with the matter. Virtual service advisors in an office in Utah are now handling range cases, the person said. Reuters could not determine why the change was made.


The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) signs off on fuel economy and driving range estimates.

The EPA required Tesla to slightly lower driving range estimates that it planned to put on window stickers for six recent models after the agency’s own testing. But the EPA said such variation is not uncommon in testing by makers of electric vehicles.
On the road

By the time Alexandre Ponsin reached California on his March road trip, he had stopped to charge his Model 3’s battery about a dozen times.

Concerned that something was seriously wrong with the car, he had called and texted with several Tesla representatives. One of them booked the first available appointment in Santa Clara – about two weeks away – but advised him to show up at a Tesla service center as soon as he arrived in California.

Ponsin soon received a text saying that remote diagnostics had shown his battery “is in good health.”

“We would like to cancel your visit for now if you have no other concerns,” the text read.

“Of course I still have concerns,” Ponsin shot back. “I have 150 miles of range on a full charge!”

The next day, he received another text message asking him to cancel the appointment. “I am sorry, but no I do not want to close the service appointment as I do not feel my concerns have been addressed,” he replied.

Undeterred, Ponsin brought his car to the Santa Clara service center without an appointment. A technician there told him the car was fine. “It lasted 10 minutes,” Ponsin said, “and they didn’t even look at the car physically.”

After doing more research into range estimates, he said he ultimately concluded there is nothing wrong with his car. The problem, he said, was that Tesla is overstating its performance. He believes Tesla “should be a lot more explicit about the variation in the range,” especially in very cold weather.

“I do love my Tesla,” the engineer said. “But I have just tempered my expectation of what it can do in certain conditions.”"
Tesla shares dip in premarket trade after reports the firm will lay off more than 10% of global workforce,1336,0.95,383,2024-04-15,"Tesla shares were down over 1% in premarket trade Monday on media reports that the automaker will lay off more than 10% of its global workforce.

The company’s stock was down 1.20% in premarket deals at roughly 7:30 a.m. ET.

“As we prepare the company for our next phase of growth, it is extremely important to look at every aspect of the company for cost reductions and increasing productivity,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in an internal memo cited by Reuters, which tech publication Electrek referenced in the first report of the layoffs.

“As part of this effort, we have done a thorough review of the organization and made the difficult decision to reduce our headcount by more than 10% globally,” the memo said.

CNBC was unable to independently verify the memo and has reached out for comment.

Elon Musk tells Twitter staff he sold Tesla stock to save the social network,3040,0.95,624,2022-11-10," 

Twitter's new owner Elon Musk, who is also CEO of electric vehicle maker [Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/) and U.S. defense contractor SpaceX, told employees of the social media business on Thursday that he recently sold shares of Tesla to ""save Twitter.""

He made the remarks during an all-hands meeting that he hosted in part to motivate Twitter employees who remain after sweeping layoffs to work hard. Musk let go of about half of Twitter employees following his acquisition of the company for $44 billion, or $54.20 per share.

[As CNBC previously reported,](https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/) to finance his portion of that take-private deal, last week Musk sold at least another $3.95 billion worth of [Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/) stock. According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission published Tuesday, the batch of shares he just sold amounted to 19.5 million more shares of Tesla.

Earlier this year, he also sold over $8 billion worth of Tesla stock in April and roughly $7 billion worth in August.

Musk has [brought in employees from Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/31/elon-musk-has-pulled-more-than-50-tesla-engineers-into-twitter.html), including dozens of Autopilot engineers, to help with code review and other work at Twitter along with friends, financial backers and deputies from other companies that he has co-founded.

 

Among other things, [Musk wants Twitter to generate half of its revenue from Twitter Blue subscribers](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/10/read-elon-musks-first-email-to-all-twitter-employees.html), and to become less reliant on advertising revenue.

Musk’s Twitter distraction has shaken some of Tesla’s most stalwart bulls. For example, [CNBC Pro reported](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/10/wedbush-removes-tesla-from-its-top-stocks-list-says-twitter-deal-an-albatross.html), Wedbush Securities has removed Tesla from its top stock list.

"Tesla video promoting self driving was staged, engineer testifies",2696,0.91,608,2023-01-18,"Jan 17 [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/tesla-video-promoting-self-driving-was-staged-engineer-testifies-2023-01-17/?utm_source=reddit.com) - ""A 2016 video that Tesla (TSLA.O) used to promote its self-driving technology was staged to show capabilities like stopping at a red light and accelerating at a green light that the system did not have, according to testimony by a senior engineer.

The video, which remains archived on Tesla’s website, was released in October 2016 and promoted on Twitter by Chief Executive Elon Musk as evidence that “Tesla drives itself.”

To create the video, the Tesla used 3D mapping on a predetermined route from a house in Menlo Park, California, to Tesla’s then-headquarters in Palo Alto, he said.

Drivers intervened to take control in test runs, he said. When trying to show the Model X could park itself with no driver, a test car crashed into a fence in Tesla’s parking lot, he said.

“The intent of the video was not to accurately portray what was available for customers in 2016. It was to portray what was possible to build into the system,” Tesla's lawyer said, according to a transcript of his testimony seen by Reuters.

When Tesla released the video, Musk tweeted, “Tesla drives itself (no human input at all) thru urban streets to highway to streets, then finds a parking spot.”

Tesla faces lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny over its driver assistance systems.

The U.S. Department of Justice began a criminal investigation into Tesla’s claims that its electric vehicles can drive themselves in 2021, after a number of crashes, some of them fatal, involving Autopilot, Reuters has reported.

The New York Times reported in 2021 that Tesla engineers had created the 2016 video to promote Autopilot without disclosing that the route had been mapped in advance or that a car had crashed in trying to complete the shoot, citing anonymous sources.

When asked if the 2016 video showed the performance of the Tesla Autopilot system available in a production car at the time, Elluswamy said, ""It does not.""

Elluswamy was deposed in a lawsuit against Tesla over a 2018 crash in Mountain View, California, that killed Apple engineer Walter Huang. ""


What do you guys make of all this? Is everyone still permabullsih on Tesla or are the tides turning against them? Of course Elon is no longer chairman so doesnt have as much control as previously, however he does still have significant control of the company and bad PR for him often means bad PR for Tesla. The two are almost inextricably linked given his holdings.

Personally I don't want to touch anything this man is involved with and haven't done so for a good year now, and that seems to be working pretty well. Kudos to anyone who's been making bank swing trading Tesla though and good luck to those who believe in the company long term. I wish I could, but I just don't trust them."
Tesla stock has best day in over a decade on Musk's 2025 growth projection,551,0.8,387,2024-10-24,"Tesla shares soared 22% to close at $260.48 on Thursday, the stock’s best day since 2013, following the company’s better-than-expected earnings report.

The company late Wednesday reported revenue of $25.18 billion, which came in just under analysts’ expectations of $25.37 billion, but was up 8% compared with a year earlier. Tesla reported earnings per share of 72 cents adjusted, topping the average analyst estimate of 58 cents.

“We expect this surprising earnings beat to power a strong positive reaction in Tesla shares Thursday, given the degree to which investors have become conditioned to earnings misses from the company,” analysts at JPMorgan wrote in a note.

Tesla’s profit margins in the third quarter were boosted by $739 million in revenue for environmental regulatory credits, which the JPMorgan analysts noted were a “potentially unsustainable driver” of earnings and cash flow.

Automakers are required to obtain a certain amount of regulatory credits every year, and if they can’t meet the target, they can buy credits from other companies. Tesla has excess credits because it only makes electric vehicles.

Tesla earnings also got a boost from FSD, the company’s Full Self-Driving Supervised system. CFO Vaibhav Taneja said on the earnings call that FSD contributed $326 million in revenue in the quarter after Tesla made it available for use in the Cybertruck and added a feature called “Actually Smart Summon.”

CEO Elon Musk said on the call that his “best guess” is that “vehicle growth” will reach 20% to 30% next year, citing “lower cost vehicles” and the “advent of autonomy.” Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting delivery growth of about 15% for 2025.

Even bullish Deutsche Bank analysts doubted Musk’s forecast and wrote, in a note following the earnings report, “Our view remains more reserved at 10-15% (~2.03m),” and assumes Tesla can roll out a cheaper version of its Model Y at a price under $30,000 after subsidies, and other variants of the small SUV.

Analysts at Morgan Stanley who also recommend buying the stock, called Musk’s 2025 vehicle delivery growth prediction a “maybe.” They set their estimate at 14%.

It “clearly depends on the company’s ability to improve affordability through cheaper model (next gen) introduction, financing offers and improved features,” the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note Thursday.

A grain of salt

Musk said on the Wednesday call that Tesla plans to start production of its recently unveiled Cybercab, a robotaxi with butterfly doors and no steering wheel or pedals, by the end of 2026. He also said Tesla would conduct driverless ridehailing in California and Texas next year in its existing cars, which are not currently safe to use without a human driver ready to steer or brake at any time.

Bernstein analysts, who have a bearish price target of $120 on shares of Tesla, wrote in a note out Thursday: “The tone of Tesla’s conference call was ebullient and filled with Musk prognostications that have historically polarized bull and bear investors, and was more akin to a pep rally, with the company only taking two questions from sell-siders.”

Musk has for years promised shareholders a software upgrade that can turn Teslas into robotaxis. That hasn’t happened yet. Musk has also promised a refreshed version of the Tesla Roadster since 2017. The design of the vehicle is not yet complete. 

The Bernstein analysts wrote, “We continue to struggle to see Tesla overcoming the technological and regulatory hurdles needed to leapfrog current level 4 robotaxis, and believe fully unsupervised FSD could be years away.”

They pointed to Musk’s “long history of being overly optimistic about FSD” and said crowdsourced research that shows “Tesla continues to lag well behind competitors” on robotaxis.

The share rally Thursday was the sharpest since a 24% gain in May 2013. The jump erased Tesla’s loss for the year and left the stock up 3% in 2024, though it still trails the 22% gain for the Nasdaq.

Bill Gates has a short position against Tesla Inc. that would now need between $1.5 billion and $2 billion to close out, Elon Musk said Friday in a series of tweets.

Musk said the position was $500 million and grew after Tesla “went up a lot.”

When asked last year on CNBC whether he was short Tesla, Gates said, “I don’t talk about my investments.”

Musk was replying to tweets after the close of his Twitter poll asking who respondents trust less -- politicians or billionaires. More than 75% said they had less trust in politicians.

Tesla has surged past $525 billion in market value and could soon overtake Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. Here's why that's astounding,5189,0.94,852,2020-11-26,"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tesla-market-capitalization-warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-2020-11?amp

Buffett's company earned $255 billion in revenue and booked $73 billion in investment gains last year, fueling $81 billion in net income. Moreover, it held $137 billion in cash and short-term investments at the end of March — enough to buy Tesla in its entirety at the time, as its market value had tumbled below $100 billion during the coronavirus crash.

Meanwhile, Tesla had about 48,000 full-time workers last year, less than an eighth of Berkshire's workforce. It also generated about $25 billion in sales — a tenth of Berkshire's revenue — and posted a $900 million net loss. Musk's company also had only $6.6 billion in net assets last year, less than 1/60th of Berkshire's $425 billion.

Ford CEO Jim Farley says Tesla price cuts could start an EV price war,1917,0.95,578,2023-04-21,"https://news.yahoo.com/ford-ceo-jim-farley-says-110356902.html

Ford CEO Jim Farley said Tesla's price cuts could spark an electric-vehicle price war and transform some into commodities.

At a charity event in Detroit reported on by Bloomberg, Farley said Tesla's attempts to increase sales were ""completely rational and should surprise no one.""

Elon Musk's company has slashed the price of its cars six times this year, making the EVs more affordable than they have been for years. The cheapest model, Tesla's entry-level Model 3 sedan, now costs less than $40,000.

In January, Ford followed Tesla in cutting EV prices, discounting its plug-in Mustang Mach-E range by between about 1% and 8.8%.

""Price wars are breaking out everywhere,"" Farley said. Who's going to blink for growth?""

Tesla's price cuts are aimed at undercutting rivals and boosting market share, but the strategy has cost the company.

On Wednesday, the automaker logged revenue of $23.33 billion, which was roughly in line with estimates, according to Refinitiv. But its profits took a hit as net income plummeted 24% year-on-year to $2.51 billion during the three months ending March 31.

Seth Goldstein, an equities strategist for Morningstar, told Insider Tesla's price cuts had left legacy automakers scrambling. He said Ford, which previously predicted its EV business would keep losing money until at least 2026, was faced with the ""potential of having to cut prices or hurt profits even more.""

""That makes for an interesting scenario in terms of how they respond,"" Goldstein said.

Farley said at the Detroit event that Ford would focus on areas where there was less competition, such as pickup trucks and vans, Reuters reported.

Sold all my Tesla shares. ,650,0.82,515,2024-07-03,"Before the bulls start thrashing me, I just want to say I don't do any shorting of Tesla. 

Long term Tesla is a great stock to own if we're patient, as it stands given the current momentum it feels like it'll be short-lived and we'll be back to the low 170s. 

With the robotaxi reveal just less than a month away the stock will continue to pump, but as the quote from intelligent investor says, ""An intelligent investor is someone who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists"" this pump up to robotaxi reveal feels that way. Which is artificial. 

I'm not anti Elon. I'm not anti Tesla. I admire what elon has achieved and love Tesla as a company. But to any small retail investors that are holding the stock out there, do give this a thought. 

What does the community overall think about Tesla stock price?. Is it going only up now? Or below 180s, 170s level is gone forever?.

Tesla execs Drew Baglino and Rohan Patel depart as company announces layoffs,1056,0.96,352,2024-04-15,"Tesla executives Drew Baglino and Rohan Patel announced Monday they are leaving the electric vehicle maker and clean energy company. CEO Elon Musk thanked both departing execs on X, the social network he owns and runs as chief technology officer.

The news comes after Tesla said it is laying off more than 10% of its workforce.

Baglino had worked with Tesla since its early years, starting as a firmware and electrical engineer in 2006. He most recently reported directly to Musk as the company’s senior vice president for powertrain and energy engineering.

Patel joined Tesla in 2016 after working as a senior advisor to former President Barack Obama on climate and energy issues, among other policy matters.

Reuters recently reported that Tesla has set aside plans to make a more affordable new EV at Musk’s direction. The strategy shift includes a greater focus on developing a “robotaxi” and comes amid steep competition including from BYD and other Chinese automakers with more affordable electric cars.

Patel and Baglino had been deeply involved in battery and vehicle manufacturing, related policy, and turning Tesla into a multinational EV manufacturer. They were less involved in autonomous vehicle technology at Tesla. 

Baglino wrote in a post on X:

“I made the difficult decision to move on from Tesla after 18 years yesterday. I am so thankful to have worked with and learned from the countless incredibly talented people at Tesla over the years. I loved tackling nearly every problem we solved as a team and feel gratified to have contributed to the mission of accelerating the transition to sustainable energy, a mission that I am quite passionate about.”

Musk responded on the platform, “Thanks for everything you’ve done for Tesla. Few have contributed as much as you.”

As of Monday morning, Tesla had not yet updated the “leadership” information on its corporate webpage to reflect Baglino’s departure.

Patel wrote in a post on the social network, “The past 8 years at Tesla have been filled with every emotion — but the feeling I have today is utmost gratitude,” adding, “My immigrant parents worked their asses off and as a result I’m the luckiest dude. Lucky to have been a part of @BarackObama’s campaign/administration, and truly honored to have worked at @Tesla to positively changing multiple industries.”

Musk replied to Patel, saying, “Thanks for everything you’ve done for Tesla. Much appreciated.”

The CEO also said, in a post on X on Monday, “About every 5 years, we need to reorganize and streamline the company for the next phase of growth.”

Baglino and Patel were not immediately available for comment.

How does Tesla go up 7% after all the news about Elon Musk’s autopilot incident?,1176,0.82,857,2023-08-29,"I guess I need to add this: I do **not** own any stocks or shorts or puts or whatever related to Tesla, because the way that Tesla works in the market confuses me. I just want to learn. 

Everybody also thinks this is an attack on Tesla and Musk. It is **not**. I want to know if this is the way that the market works or not.

Why do I care? Because Tesla is relatively a gigantic company. Why did I ask about if the same would happen with Apple? Because Apple is also a relatively gigantic company. 

I thought you were allowed to ask about stocks on this sub. 

———

On Friday August 25th, [Elon Musk posted a video on X](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1695247110030119054?s=46&t=0YLBKtmQe8-F_nJ00NQvxg), that now has 44 million views, of him driving a Tesla on autopilot. In the video he has to brake the car himself when it almost runs a red light (at around 19:45). It also received a decent amount of news coverage. 

This appears to have not affected the stock’s value at all and as of the closing today (August 29th) the stock is up over 7%

I’d expect such an incident to have negative effects on a company’s value, but this didn’t. 

Are these sorts of things usually just not big deals? 

If Apple were demonstrating their new iPhone’s amazing app that works perfectly and then it caused the phone to crash, would that negatively affect the value?

Or is it basically all just about the money that the company brings in?

—— 

Thanks to everybody who answered nicely. I’ve gotten some explanations that make sense including:

- Elon’s livestream video wasn’t of current autopilot software on Teslas, but rather a beta FSD which performed very well. 
- 44 million people probably didn’t actually see that moment where “human intervention” takes place. Plus the media blew it out of proportion. 
- Computer trading algorithms don’t care about these minute things. 
- This isn’t exclusive to Tesla. Similar things like this happening to other gigantic companies happen and they barely matter. 
- The market overall went up on the 29th and Tesla has a high beta.

Dec 30 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) is recalling more than 475,000 of its Model 3 and Model S electric cars to address rearview camera and trunk issues that increase the risk of crashing, the U.S. road safety regulator said.

Tesla shares were down 1.1% in premarket trading on Thursday.

The U.S. electric vehicle manufacturer is recalling 356,309 2017-2020 Model 3 vehicles to address rearview camera issues and 119,009 Model S vehicles due to front hood problems, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said.

Tesla shares jump 6% on profit beat,341,0.79,479,2024-10-23,"* Tesla reported third-quarter earnings on Wednesday that topped analysts’ estimates even as revenue came in just shy of expectations.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 72 cents vs. 58 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $25.18 billion vs. $25.37 billion expected

Revenue increased 8% in the quarter from $23.35 billion a year earlier. Net income rose to about $2.17 billion, or 62 cents a share, from $1.85 billion, or 53 cents s share, a year ago.

Tesla’s profit margins were bolstered by $739 million in automotive regulatory credit revenue during the quarter. The company has also been offering an array of discounts and incentives to spur sales.

Automotive revenue increased 2% to $20 billion from $19.63 billion in the same period a year earlier. Energy generation and storage revenue soared 52% to $2.38 billion, while services and other revenue jumped 29% to $2.79 billion.

Operating margin was reported at 10.8% of sales to improve from last quarter's mark of 6.3%, and top last year's mark of 7.6%. Total GAAP gross margin was 19.8% vs. 17.9% a year ago and 18.0% in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.67 billion vs. $3.76 billion a year ago. For the quarter, the EV juggernaut's adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 18.5% of sales from 16.1% a year ago.

# 

Tesla had already disclosed 462,890 deliveries for Q3. The electric vehicle maker said it produced 469,796 vehicles during the quarter. Tesla noted that 3% of the deliveries were subject to operating lease accounting. For reference, Tesla delivered 443,956 vehicles in Q2 of this year and 435,059 vehicles in Q3 of last year. Tesla's  all-time deliveries record was 484,507 vehicles in Q4 of 2023. Looking ahead, Tesla reiterated that plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025.

# More than just EVs

Tesla said energy storage deployments decreased sequentially in Q3 to a record 6.9 GWh, but were up 75% Y/Y. Overall, Tesla said energy services and other businesses are becoming increasingly profitable parts of the company. ""As energy storage products continue to ramp, and our vehicle fleet continues to grow, we are expecting continued profit growth from these businesses over time,"" noted TSLA. The company also said that it deployed and is training ahead of schedule on a 29k H100 cluster at Gigafactory Texas, where it expects to have 50k H100 capacity by the end of October.

# Balance sheet

Tesla ended the quarter with a cash position of $33.6 billion. The sequential increase of $2.9 billion was a result of positive free cash flow of $2.7 billion. Operating cash flow was $6.3 billion during the quarter.

**SUMMARY**

We delivered strong results in Q3 with growth in vehicle deliveries both sequentially and year-on-year, resulting in record third-quarter volumes. We also recognized our second-highest quarter of regulatory credit revenues as other OEMs are still behind on meeting emissions requirements.

Our cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle came down to its lowest level ever at \~$35,100. In order to continue accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy, we need to make EVs affordable for everyone, including making total cost of ownership per mile competitive with all forms of transportation. Preparations remain underway for our offering of new vehicles – including more affordable models – which we will begin launching in the first half of 2025. At our ""We, Robot"" event on October 10, we detailed our long-term goal of offering autonomous transport with a cost per mile below rideshare, personal car ownership, and even public transit.

The Energy business achieved another strong quarter with a record gross margin. Additionally, the Megafactory in Lathrop produced 200 Megapacks in a week, and Powerwall deployments reached a record for the second quarter in a row as we continue to ramp Powerwall 3.

Despite sustained macroeconomic headwinds and others pulling back on EV investments, we remain focused on expanding our vehicle and energy product lineup, reducing costs and making critical investments in AI projects and production capacity. We believe these efforts will allow us to capitalize on the ongoing transition in the transportation and energy sectors."

Tesla pops 6% in premarket after Elon Musk says he is set for victory in $56 billion pay vote ,632,0.85,437,2024-06-13,"Shares of Tesla popped in premarket trading, after Elon Musk said shareholders are set to approve his controversial $56 billion pay package and a resolution to move the electric carmaker’s incorporation to Texas.

At 08:12 a.m. ET on Thursday, Tesla shares were 6.39% higher in premarket trading.

Tesla shareholders have been voting on two resolutions and can have their say up to the company’s annual meeting on Thursday. The first measure under consideration is whether to green light a $56 billion pay package that shareholders originally approved in 2018, before being voided by a Delaware judge in January.

The second resolution is whether Tesla should transfer its state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas. That proposal was put forward after Musk asked his followers on social media platform X earlier this year whether Tesla should carry out such a move — to a resounding yes.

Musk now said that both of these resolutions are currently passing by “wide margins,” without disclosing specifics or his sourcing.

CNBC has reached out to Tesla for comment.

The initial pay package had aggressive targets for Tesla’s financial performance and market value — and, while the company has turned into one of the world’s largest electric automakers, a lot has changed since 2018.

Tesla is facing slowing growth and increased competition, especially from Chinese players. In that time, Musk also bought Twitter, now called X, and has ramped up focus on other projects, including in his brain computer interface firm Neuralink and artificial intelligence company xAI.

Critics of the pay deal argue that Musk is distracted by his other endeavors, and that the package, the largest in U.S. corporate history, is excessive. More recently, they say that Tesla’s financial performance has not been up to scratch.

Some notable shareholders have said they planned to vote against the deal, and top proxy advisors Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis also recommended this step. The California State Teachers’ Retirement System, a massive pension fund, likewise objected to the package, claiming the sum was too high. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund has similarly come out in opposition.

Shareholders in favor of the compensation argue that Musk is integral to Tesla’s future success and that the billionaire will take his efforts elsewhere if he is not reimbursed adequately. They claim that the pay package has incentivized Musk.

Billionaire investor and long-time Tesla shareholder Ron Baron said he is voting in favor of the pay package, suggesting that Musk is key to the EV maker’s future.

“At Baron Capital, our answer is clear, loud, and unequivocal: Tesla is better with Elon. Tesla is Elon,” he said this month.

Some major investors, such as Vanguard and Blackrock, have meanwhile not said how they will cast their votes.

"Tesla to recall 3,878 Cybertrucks over faulty accelerator pedal, NHTSA says",1191,0.95,233,2024-04-19,"April 19 (Reuters) - Tesla [(TSLA.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/TSLA.O) is recalling 3,878 Cybertrucks to fix an accelerator pedal pad that could come loose and get lodged in the interior trim, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said on Friday.

A trapped accelerator pedal could cause the vehicle to accelerate unintentionally, increasing the risk of a crash, the auto safety regulator said in a [notice, opens new tab](https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2024/RCAK-24V276-5059.pdf).

Tesla started deliveries of its Cybertruck electric pickup truck late last year, after a two-year delay due to production problems and battery-supply constraints.

The EV maker will replace or repair the accelerator pedal assembly at no charge and owners will be notified through letters mailed to them in June, the NHTSA said.

In the first quarter of 2024 Tesla had three recalls affecting about 2.4 million vehicles, according to a report by recall management firm BizzyCar.

However, most issues related to Tesla recalls are usually resolved through over-the-air software updates.

In February, Tesla [recalled](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-recall-over-2-mln-vehicles-us-nhtsa-2024-02-02/) about 2.2 million vehicles in the United States due to an incorrect font size on warning lights and U.S. safety regulators [upgraded their probe](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-recall-over-2-mln-vehicles-us-nhtsa-2024-02-02/) into the company's vehicles over power steering loss to the status of an engineering analysis.

Elon Musk says Rivian needs to ‘cut costs massively’ and its execs should ‘live in the factory’ or the Tesla rival will die,847,0.78,470,2024-02-26,"Elon Musk is not surprised by the bad news hitting Tesla rival Rivian. He’s been warning about it for some time.

On Wednesday, Rivian announced a disappointing quarter and outlook and said it would cut its salaried workforce by roughly 10%.

Shortly after, Musk wrote on X that the rival maker of electric vehicles would go bankrupt in about six quarters on the current trajectory, adding, “Maybe that trajectory will change, but so far it hasn’t.”

“They need to cut costs massively and the exec team needs to live in the factory or they will die,” he wrote.

Musk, having gone through “production hell” and “sleeping at the factory” himself at Tesla, should know.

The billionaire has warned about Rivian’s challenges before. In June 2022, he said his advice for the company would be “to cut costs immediately across the board dramatically or they’re doomed.”

My 58-year-old father put his entire 401k into Tesla stock. How do you explain the volatility risk and lack of diversification to a parent?,1390,0.94,781,2023-03-08,"Hi Reddit!

I've (30M) been stressed about my father's retirement savings ever since he told me he converted his entire savings from a normal target date fund to 100% Tesla stock. This occurred in 2020 around the same timeframe of the first stock split, and all contributions to date have been Tesla.

For background both my dad and I have loved the company and their products for years, but we differ in that I think the stock is heavily overpriced, and he has latched on to the valuations and extremely bullish forecasts people like Kathy Woods assign to Tesla. He's convinced the stock is going to rocket to 4 - 10X its current value before he retires, and hasn't really reacted to the bearish arguments I've laid out acknowledging how much more expensive the company is than every other automaker and how competition is increasing in the space. Not to mention that much of its valuation is currently highly speculative such as ""robo-taxis"" while their FSD is starting to fall behind competitors in execution and is still not (and may never be) fully delivered.

Setting the valuation of Tesla debate aside, I would never advise any person at any age to put 100% of their retirement portfolio in any single stock, let alone one as risky as Tesla. I've tried explaining the extreme risk in a zero diversity portfolio, where if this single company goes under he loses his entire retirement fund (""all your eggs are in one basket""), but he doesn't seem to take it seriously.

My fear is that he is already behind on where he probably should be in his retirement savings. He's told me before he spoke with a financial advisor before doing this, and he didn't have enough funds to manage with them. I feel he is making this gamble as he thinks its the only way to catch up, not recognizing he could also lose it all. I know he has not talked to any advisors since about his current investment strategy.

Some questions I'm hoping you can help answer for him and I, so he has an outside perspective:

If you are neutral or bearish on Tesla, how would you explain the issues and risks with its va;ue going forward?

If you are bullish on Tesla, are you investing 100% of your savings in it, and would you advise a 58-year-old to do the same with their retirement savings? Why or why not?

How would you explain the risk of his current plan to him, and what alternatives would you suggest?

What should an ideal retirement portfolio look like for someone his age?

What resources do you believe would be good to share with him that might help reopen the conversation on reducing his risk and impressing the importance of diversification?

It's not an easy conversation to have with a parent, and ultimately I respect that he's an adult who can do what he wants with his money. I've tried a few times to have it but its difficult to balance not being taken as condescending to your own father while explaining how insanely risky you think his financial decisions are. It's made it more difficult by the high upturns TSLA has taken in stretches, validating all his beliefs, but with the subsequent downturns he's doubled down and not acknowledged the volatility and risk. I fear with him consuming positive bullish Tesla content exclusively, he is not considering bearish outcomes or basic retirement savings advice. Any feedback from the community that can offer an alternative view would be highly appreciated, as I hope I can share some of your resources and opinions with him next time I retry this conversation.

Thanks so much!  


EDIT: For those asking, I believe he got in at late August 2020 timeframe, around what is now the $120 - $140 price range.  He has averaged up basically ever since, so not clear on what the current average price is.  I think he is up now on original investment, but down on most continued contributions."
Tesla jumps 10% in premarket trade after passing key hurdle to roll out full self-driving in China,703,0.89,413,2024-04-29,"Shares of Tesla rose sharply in U.S. premarket trading on Monday after the electric car maker passes a significant milestone to roll out its full self-driving technology in China.

The company’s share price spiked more than 10% just after 7:30 a.m. ET, as investors reacted to news surrounding Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s visit to China.

Tesla on Sunday said that local Chinese authorities removed restrictions on its cars after passing the country’s data security requirements.

The move raised expectations that Tesla’s driver-assistance software Full Self Driving (FSD) would soon be available in the country, which is the largest market for electric vehicles.

While Tesla’s electric cars are some of the most popular vehicles in China, they have reportedly been banned from some government-related properties due to data security concerns.

Separately, the Biden administration earlier this year announced a probe into whether imported cars from China pose national security risks due to their ability to potentially collect sensitive data.

FSD is an upgrade to Tesla’s Autopilot driver assistant. Tesla has offered its FSD technology in China for years, but with a restricted feature set that limits it to operations, such as automated lane changing.

Data security concerns have been a key obstacle preventing Tesla from achieving a full rollout of the system in China.

Tesla also reportedly scored a deal with Baidu that would give Musk’s firm access to the Chinese internet giant’s mapping and navigation technology for Tesla’s FSD feature.

The agreement would allow Tesla to tap into Baidu’s mapping service license, which is a requirement for intelligence driving systems to operate on public roads in China, Reuters reported, citing two anonymous sources familiar with the matter.

CNBC was unable to independently verify the report. Tesla and Baidu were not immediately available for comment.

With the license, which foreign companies can only clinch in partnership with local Chinese firms, Tesla will be allowed to legally operate FSD on Chinese roads, and its fleets will be able to gather data about traffic, road signs and routes.

The breakthrough for Tesla toward bringing its FSD self-driving technology to China marks a key win for the firm at a time when it is facing hefty competition in the Chinese market. Local rivals such as Warren Buffett-backed electric vehicle maker BYD, Nio, and Xpeng have ramped up their competition with Tesla in recent years.

BYD was temporarily the largest electric vehicle maker globally, producing more than 3 million new energy vehicles in 2023. The firm recently lost its crown as world’s largest EV maker, after a 43% plunge in sales in the first quarter.

More Tesla employees laid off as bloodbath enters its fourth week,906,0.93,266,2024-05-06,"Tesla’s brutal round of layoffs entered its fourth week, with more employees posting on LinkedIn and elsewhere about receiving notice that their time at the company has come to an end.

The most recent layoffs, which were first reported by Electrek and Business Insider, appear to be hitting different segments of the company, including software, services, and engineering. Employees said they received layoff notices over the weekend and on Monday.

It’s unclear how many employees have been affected. Business Insider reported at least seven employees posted about being laid off on Sunday.

The layoffs first started last month, when Tesla began laying off what was said to be at the time 10 percent of the company’s global workforce of 140,000 people. The layoffs included Tesla’s head of EV charging, Rebecca Tinucci, as well as her entire 500-person team. Tesla’s head of the new vehicles program, Daniel Ho, was also let go.

On X, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company needed to be reorganized every five years. And in an email to employees, he said the company needed to be “absolutely hard core” about the cuts and that staffers working under executives who “don’t obviously pass the excellent, necessary and trustworthy test” would be out of a job.

According to Bloomberg, Musk privately expressed a desire to lay off at least 20 percent of the company because its quarterly vehicle deliveries fell by that much.

Tesla is going through one of its toughest financial situations in years, with sales dropping and profits down 55 percent year over year. The company is experiencing increased competition, both in the US and in China, while also dealing with waning demand for EVs globally.

And Musk has been downplaying Tesla’s vehicle business in an effort to position the company as a leader in autonomous vehicles, promising to unveil a fully autonomous robotaxi later this year.

Musk says robots could make Tesla $25 trillion company — more than half value of S&P 500 ,532,0.73,455,2024-06-13,"The entire value of the S&P 500 currently stands at $45.5 trillion, according to FactSet. Tesla CEO Elon Musk claimed on Thursday that his company’s Optimus humanoid robots could eventually make the automaker worth more than half of that.

Musk, who characterized himself as “pathologically optimistic” at the 2024 annual shareholder meeting in Austin, Texas, said Tesla is embarking on not just a “new chapter” in its life, but is about to write an entirely “new book.” Optimus appears to be one of the main characters.

Tesla first revealed its plans to work on humanoid robots in 2021 at an AI Day event, trotting out a dancer in a unitard that looked like a sleek, androgynous robot.

In January, Tesla showed off Optimus robots folding laundry in a demo video that was immediately criticized by robotics engineers for being deceptive. The robots were not autonomous, but were rather being operated with humans at the controls.

At the shareholder event on Thursday, Musk didn’t divulge exactly what Optimus can do today. He suggested the robots some day will perform like R2-D2 and C-3PO in Star Wars. They could cook or clean for you, do factory work, or even teach your children, Musk suggested.

As for shareholder value, Musk said Optimus could be the catalyst for lifting Tesla’s market cap to $25 trillion someday.

Speaking to a crowd consisting mostly of fawning fanboys in an auditorium at the Gigafactory, Musk promised Tesla would move into “limited production” of Optimus in 2025 and test out humanoid robots in its own factories next year.

The company, he predicted, will have “over 1,000, or a few thousand, Optimus robots working at Tesla” in 2025.

This is all far-out stuff even for Musk, who is notorious for making ambitious promises to investors and customers that don’t pan out — from developing software that can turn an existing Tesla into a self-driving vehicle with an upload, to EV battery swapping stations.

Getting to a $25 trillion market cap would mean that Tesla would be worth about eight times Apple’s value today. The iPhone maker is currently the world’s biggest company by market cap, just ahead of Microsoft.

At Thursday’s close, Tesla was valued at about $580 billion, making it the 10th most valuable company in the S&P 500.

Musk didn’t provide a timeframe for reaching $25 trillion. He did say that autonomous vehicles could get the company to a market cap of $5 trillion to $7 trillion.

Musk said he agreed with numbers from long-time Tesla bull Cathie Wood, the CEO of ARK Invest. This week, ARK put a $2,600 price target on Tesla’s stock by 2029, betting on a commercial robotaxi business that the company has yet to enter.

Wood’s price target equals a market cap for Tesla of over $8 trillion.

Musk’s comments at the annual meeting followed the shareholder vote to reinstate the CEO’s $56 billion pay plan, five months after a Delaware court ordered the company to rescind the package. The crowd cheered when the proposal was read aloud, and when preliminary results were announced.

Taking the stage following the readout of the shareholder votes, Musk said, “I just want to start off by saying hot d---! I love you guys.”

Tesla shares have dropped 27% this year as the company reckons with a sales decline that’s tied in part to an aging lineup of electric vehicles and increased competition in China. The company has also implemented steep layoffs. Musk has encouraged investors to look past the current state of the business and more toward a future of autonomous driving, robots and artificial intelligence.

Among his boldest claims on Thursday was Musk’s declaration that Tesla had advanced so far in developing silicon that it’s surpassed Nvidia when it comes to inference, or the process that trained machine learning models use to draw conclusions from new data.

Nvidia shares have soared almost nine-fold since the end of 2022, driven by demand for its AI chips. The company is now worth about $3.2 trillion.

One concern swirling around Musk is his focus on Tesla given all of his other commitments. He owns and runs social media company X, is CEO of SpaceX, and founded The Boring Co. and Neuralink. He launched another startup, xAI, in March last year and the company recently raised $6 billion in venture funding.

Musk was asked by a shareholder at the meeting how important he is, personally, to the future of Tesla.

“I’m a helpful accelerant to that future,” he said, emphasizing his role in innovation.

He said that, when it comes to humanoid robots, other companies, including tech startups, are going after the market. Competitors include Boston Dynamics, Agility, Neura and Apptronik.

“What really matters is, can we be much faster than everyone else and our product be done a few years before theirs and be better,” Musk said.

Xiaomi releases electric car $4K cheaper than Tesla's Model 3 as price wars heat up,890,0.92,311,2024-03-28,"Chinese smartphone company Xiaomi said Thursday it will sell its first car for far less than Tesla’s Model 3, as price wars heat up in China’s fiercely competitive electric car market.

Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun said the standard version of the SU7 will sell for 215,900 yuan ($30,408) in the country — a price he acknowledged would mean the company was selling each car at a loss.

Tesla’s Model 3 starts at 245,900 yuan in China.

Lei claimed the standard version of the SU7 beat the Model 3 on more than 90% of its specifications, except on two aspects that he said it might take Xiaomi at least three to five years to catch up with Tesla on. He also said the SU7 had a minimum driving range of 700 kilometers (nearly 435 miles) versus the Model 3′s 606 kilometers. The company said orders had exceeded 50,000 cars in the 27 minutes since sales started at 10 p.m. Beijing time Thursday.

Deliveries are set to start by the end of April, Lei said. Lei also claimed that Xiaomi’s car factory, for which all “key” steps are fully automated, can produce an SU7 every 76 seconds. It was not immediately clear whether the factory was fully operational.

Earlier this week, the Xiaomi CEO said on social media the SU7 would be the best sedan “under 500,000 yuan” ($69,328).

The car is entering a fiercely competitive market in China, where companies are launching a slew of new models and cutting prices in order to survive. Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei has partnered with traditional automakers, most notably launching the Aito brand whose vehicles are often on display in Huawei smartphone showrooms.

Tesla’s Model 3 is the best-selling new energy sedan in China that has a driving range of at least 600 kilometers (372 miles) and costs less than 500,000 yuan, according to data from industry website Autohome.

BYD’s Han sedan starts at 169,800 yuan, according to Autohome.

Nio’s ET5 starts at 298,000 yuan, while Xpeng’s P7 starts at 209,900 yuan, the data showed. Geely-owned Zeekr’s 007 sedan starts at 209,900 yuan, according to Autohome.

Sales of new energy vehicles, which include battery-only powered cars, have surged in China to account for about one-third of new passenger cars sold, according to the China Passenger Car Association.

Accessories

The heads of competing electric car startups Nio, Xpeng and Li Auto were among the featured guests at the Xiaomi SU7 launch event.

Lei on Thursday showed off a range of accessories such as an in-car refrigerator, a custom front-window shade, and a smartphone holder, some available for free with a car purchase before the end of April, and others for a separate price.

The SU7 supports Apple’s Car Play and can integrate with the iPad, Lei said. He also revealed driver-assist tech for highways and cities, set to be fully available in China in August.

Tesla’s Autopilot for driver assist on highways is available in China, but the company’s “Full Self Driving” for city streets has yet to be released in the country.

Despite saying Xiaomi wanted to compete with Porsche at a car tech event in December, Lei acknowledged that the SU7 had longer to go before it might be able to compete at this more premium level. He announced that the “Max” version of the SU7, aimed as a competitor with Porsche’s Taycan, would sell for 299,900 yuan.

Ecosystem of devices

The SU7 is part of Xiaomi’s recently launched “Human x Car x Home” strategy that seeks to build an ecosystem of devices connected to its new HyperOS operating system. Most of the company’s revenue is from phones, with just under 30% coming from appliances and other consumer products.

Although Xiaomi is generally known for more affordable products, its President Lu Weibing told CNBC earlier this year the company has been pursuing a premiumization strategy since 2020 — and that there are about 20 million users in that price segment who might buy the SU7.

Lu told CNBC that the SU7 will first be sold to consumers in China, and that it would take at least two to three years for any overseas launch.

The company showed off the car at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in late February, following a reveal of the vehicle’s exterior and tech in Beijing in late December.

Could Elon Musk in effect bankrupt himself if he loses the Tesla Options case and gets Margin called?,1892,0.9,429,2022-12-20,"Elon Musk has $150 Billion in Margin loans and he is being sued over $55 Billion of his Tesla options. I've seen articles saying pre split Tesla falling to $570 could trigger a Margin Call for Musk. I can't find any new articles about Elon margin call post split but I've seen on Reddit that if Tesla falls to $120-$130 post split Musk will be margin called.  If the Judge in the options case rules Musk unduly influenced the board to grant him that $55 Billion Tesla options package by being a controlling shareholder and forces him to give up that $55 Billion in Tesla shares while simultaneously Tesla falls below $120 ( which it is dangerously close to) will Musk effectively bankrupt himself? The previous greatest destruction of wealth in Modern History was Masayoshi Son losing $70 billion in the Dot Com Crash, his only saving grace being a $20 million investment in Ali Baba that swelled to $100 Billion. Do we have a front row seat to the great wealth destruction in history ($100 Billion or over)?"
"Tesla is 'profoundly overvalued,' and its exclusion from the S&P 500 was a 'brave' decision by the index committee, DataTrek says",3883,0.95,581,2020-09-10,"Tesla's exclusion from the S&P 500 index on Friday was a surprise to many, given that the mega-cap electric-vehicle manufacturer ticked off all the eligibility requirements.

Tesla on Tuesday fell 21% from Friday's close as investors digested the S&P 500 exclusion amid a tech-heavy market sell-off.

But the S&P Dow Jones Indices index committee's decision to exclude Tesla despite its eligibility for inclusion was a ""brave"" one, DataTrek cofounder Nicholas Colas said in a note on Wednesday.

The decision by the committee could ""only have come from a collective and committed view that Tesla is profoundly overvalued,"" Colas said.

Tesla traded at a trailing 12-month price-earnings multiple of 913x on Wednesday, according to data from YCharts.com. The S&P 500 traded at a trailing 12-month price-earnings multiple of 21.7x, according to JPMorgan.

In addition to a steep valuation, the committee likely thinks Tesla ""sits on shakier fundamentals"" than its August 31 market capitalization of $465.2 billion may indicate, DataTrek said.

That might refer to the fact that much of the profit Tesla has recorded over the past few quarters derives from the sale of green EV regulatory credits to other carmakers that don't meet the mandated annual EV production quota, and not from Tesla's main business of building and selling cars and solar panels.

Tesla will remain eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500 index if it continues to stay profitable in future quarters.

Instead of Tesla, the committee added Etsy, Teradyne, and Catalent to the S&P 500 index.

"Elon Musk says Tesla (TSLA) is worth $3,000 a share ‘if they execute really well’",2319,0.86,784,2021-09-07,"Elon Musk told employees that he agrees with Ark Invest that Tesla (TSLA) is worth $3,000 a share “if they execute really well.” The CEO has often commented on Tesla’s stock price, but surprisingly, it was often to say that the price was too high. 

In 2020, when Tesla’s stock was reaching new high, Musk told his millions of followers on Twitters that he believed the stock was “too high”. It sent Tesla’s stock crashing, but now it is even higher than when Musk made the comment.

Tesla is currently trading at $733 a share and the automaker is the most valuable automotive company in the world at over $730 billion.

Wall Street firms are divided on whether or not the company is overvalued, but a few of them believe that Tesla could be worth a lot more. Ark Invest is one of them. Though to be fair, the company is also a large Tesla shareholders through its investment funds.

This week, they released a new note claiming a $3,000 base stock price target by 2025 for Tesla. Cathie Wood said about the price target during an interview with Yahoo Finance: “Our estimate for Tesla’s success has gone up. The main reason for that is their market share. Instead of going down from year-end 2017 to today, it has actually gone up fairly dramatically,” In its valuation models, Ark Invest believes that Tesla is going to deliver between 5 and 10 million vehicles as soon as 2025. That’s a significant ramp considering Tesla likely will deliver less than 1 million vehicles this year. The firm is also betting on Tesla delivering a completely autonomous ride-hailing network, known as Tesla Network, that is going to bring in a lot of money with high margin.

In an email to Tesla employee obtained by Electrek, Elon Musk shared with employees Ark’s new $3,000 price target and that he agrees with Ark: “If we execute really well, I agree with Ark Invest.” A $3,000 share price would put Tesla’s valuation at $3 trillion and make it the most valuable company in the world. 

Electrek’s Take

Since Ark’s new note was an update on their valuation model and price target, it is fair to say that Musk’s email is basically a direct comment on Tesla’s stock price. He believes that “if executed really well”, Tesla should be worth $3 trillion within the next 4 years.

"Mercedes EV Breaks 1,000-Kilometer Range Barrier to Outdo Tesla",2338,0.96,468,2022-04-15,"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-13/mercedes-ev-breaks-1-000-kilometer-range-barrier-to-outdo-tesla?utm_campaign=instagram-bio-link&utm_medium=social&utm_source=instagram&utm_content=business

A Mercedes-Benz AG electric car drove more than 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) from Germany to the French Riviera on a single charge, taking the fight to seize the technology limelight from Tesla Inc. to the next level.

The EQXX prototype rode from Sindelfingen near Stuttgart via Switzerland and Italy to the Mediterranean coastal town of Cassis, the automaker said Thursday. The sedan’s lightweight chassis and aerodynamic profile allowed it to complete the trip with a battery half the size of Mercedes’s EQS flagship electric vehicle.

The EQXX “is the most efficient Mercedes ever built,” Chief Executive Officer Ola Kallenius said in a statement. “The technology program behind it marks a milestone in the development of electric vehicles.”"
Tesla Investors Voice Concern Over Elon Musk’s Focus on Twitter,1647,0.92,487,2022-12-13,"The chorus of Tesla Inc. individual investors expressing misgivings that Chief Executive Elon Musk‘s involvement with Twitter Inc. may be to the detriment of the electric-vehicle maker is getting louder, with the car company’s stock on track for its worst full-year performance.  

“There is no TSLA CEO today,” Gary Black, managing partner of the Future Fund LLC, which owns roughly $50 million worth of Tesla, tweeted Monday. 

Mr. Black voiced frustration after another sharp selloff in Tesla’s stock Monday. Shares in the world’s largest car company by market value fell more than 6% in Monday trading after a tumultuous weekend for Mr. Musk on Twitter, including the billionaire taking aim at the company’s former head of trust and safety; calling for the prosecution of top U.S. government medical adviser Anthony Fauci; and criticizing people who offer their pronouns without being asked.

Mr. Black said, “The market voted today that the $TSLA brand has been negatively impacted by the Twitter drama. Where before EV buyers were proud to drive their Teslas to their friends or show off Teslas in their driveways, now the Twitter controversy is hurting Tesla’s brand equity.”

Ross Gerber, a longtime backer of Tesla, on Monday tweeted a question directed at Tesla’s board of directors. “Who is running tesla day to day during this critical time for the company,” Mr. Gerber said. 

He separately tweeted, “There is nothing wrong at tesla at all. Other than the CEO working at another company, certainly tesla deserves a focused ceo. It would be helpful to know what Elon’s plans are.”

Mr. Musk, at a trial about his Tesla compensation package last month, said he had been spending most of his time of late focusing on Twitter, which he acquired for $44 billion. “I expect to reduce my time at Twitter and find somebody else to run Twitter over time,” he testified. 

Tesla shares are down 54.31% this year through Tuesday’s close, putting it on pace for their worst year on record. The only other year where the shares fell was in 2016, when Tesla’s stock ended down 10.97%. The Nasdaq, which advanced Tuesday, has fallen around 28% this year.

Tesla shares closed down 4.09% Tuesday, the day Mr. Musk ceded the unofficial title to European mogul Bernard Arnault for the world’s wealthiest individual, according to Bloomberg, which publishes a ranking of the richest people.

Mr. Musk’s takeover of Twitter has raised anxiety among Tesla backers for months. Several urged the Tesla CEO to abandon the deal and focus on the car maker, when shares were already down around 30%. The stock has declined further in ensuing months amid growing recession concerns and cost pressure from high inflation. Tesla also has scaled back vehicle delivery plans. Tesla’s stock has fallen about 28% since the Twitter deal closed in late October through Tuesday, when it ended trading at its lowest level in more than two years.

The Tesla boss on Tuesday tweeted: “Tesla will be great long-term, but doesn’t control macroeconomic tides.” He later added “I will make sure Tesla shareholders benefit from Twitter long-term,” but didn’t offer details.

Tesla didn’t respond to a request for comment. Mr. Musk last week said he continues to work on Tesla as well as SpaceX, formally known as Space Exploration Technologies Corp. “I continue to oversee both Tesla & SpaceX, but the teams there are so good that often little is needed from me,” he tweeted Saturday.

Bill Nelson, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s administrator, said Sunday that he had asked SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell if Mr. Musk’s purchase of the social-media platform would divert from the rocket company’s mission. Mr. Nelson said he was given assurance that wouldn’t be the case.

Leo KoGuan, a self-proclaimed Tesla investor, last week tweeted: “Tesla board is missing in action” and called on the company to initiate a share buyback. Mr. Black also has been urging the company to pursue a $10 billion share repurchase. 

Mr. Musk in October said Tesla could pursue a $5 billion to $10 billion share buyback and said some meaningful buyback was likely. The company had discussed such a share repurchase at the board level, but at the time hadn’t signed off on it. Mr. Musk has sold more than $19 billion in Tesla stock this year, including almost $4 billion in November to help finance Twitter. 

Tesla’s brand image has taken a hit in recent months, according to market surveys. Self-identifying Democrats in particular have soured on the car maker since Mr. Musk bought Twitter, according to data from research firm Morning Consult.

"Tesla stock slips after it reports 462,890 total deliveries during the third quarter",429,0.94,246,2024-10-02,"Tesla posted its third-quarter vehicle production and deliveries report on Wednesday. The stock fell about 2% in premarket trading after the report.

Here are the key numbers:

Total deliveries Q3 2024: 462,890

Total production Q3 2024: 469,796

Analysts were expecting deliveries of 463,310 in the period ending Sept. 30, according to estimates compiled by FactSet StreetAccount.

Deliveries are not defined in Tesla’s financial disclosures, but are the closest approximation to units sold reported by the company. It’s one of the most closely-watched metrics on Wall Street.

In the year-ago period, Tesla reported 435,059 deliveries and production of 430,488 EVs. Last quarter, the company reported 443,956 deliveries, and production of 410,831 vehicles.

Tesla is facing increased competitive pressure, especially in China, from companies like BYD and Geely, along with a new generation of automakers, including Li Auto and Nio.

In the U.S., EV competitors like Rivian are maturing, while legacy automakers Ford and General Motors are selling more electric vehicles after walking back more ambitious goals for electrification.

GM this week reported a roughly 60% increase in EV sales for the third quarter from a year earlier. Still, its electric business is tiny compared to Tesla’s, with just 32,100 units sold in the latest period, accounting for 4.9% of the company’s total sales.

Ford plans to report results on Wednesday.

Tesla hasn’t issued specific guidance for 2024 deliveries, but executives have said they expect a lower delivery growth rate this year versus last despite the company having added a new vehicle, the angular stainless steel Cybertruck, to their lineup.

The company also said on Wednesday that it deployed 6.9 GWh of energy storage products in the quarter.

Shares of Tesla climbed 32% in the third quarter, erasing their loss for the year in the process. The stock is now up almost 4% in 2024, trailing the Nasdaq, which has gained 19%.

Tesla’s brand has been under pressure in the U.S. due in part to the antics of CEO Elon Musk, who, in addition to endorsing former President Donald Trump, has shared what the White House called “racist hate,” and false claims about immigrants and election fraud on X, his social media app.

But Tesla still sells more battery electric vehicles in the U.S. than any other automaker, with Hyundai a distant second.

In its third-quarter earnings report later this month, investors will be particularly focused on profit margins.

Tesla has continued to offer attractive financing options and an array of incentives to drive sales volume in recent months in China as well as in the U.S. Prior to earnings, Tesla will host a marketing event on Oct. 10, and is expected to show off the design of “dedicated robotaxi.”

Musk has promised Tesla self-driving cars for years, but the company has yet to deliver. Meanwhile competitors like Waymo and Pony.ai have begun operating commercial robotaxi services.

Tesla and Toyota Are Considering Jointly Developing a Small Electric SUV Platform,4548,0.95,303,2021-03-30,"Choi Won-seok reports in the Korean Ghosun Libo news publication that according to an official from the Japanese automotive industry Toyota and Tesla have been reviewing the partnership since last year and are approaching the final stage.

Here are some of the highlights of Toyota Tesla partnership. When the partnership with Toyota is established, Tesla will be able to launch a compact SUV EV at low cost using the Toyota platform.

The Ghosun IIbo is the biggest newspaper in SK. A Tesla source Sawyer Merritt, tweets that he has been told ""the reporter of the story is also highly regarded. We'll see if it's true.""

Toyota provides the vehicle platform to Tesla, and instead, Tesla provides some of the electronic control platform and software technology installed in its vehicle to Toyota.

When the partnership with Toyota is established, Tesla will be able to launch a compact SUV electric vehicle at low cost using the Toyota platform. In addition, Tesla's sales in Japan, which are around 1,000 units per year, are likely to increase significantly.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said at the 'Battery Day' in September of last year, that Tesla ""will release a $25,000 compact and affordable electric car in 2023. However, among experts, there were several opinions that it would be difficult for Tesla to find a way to sell electric cars at such low prices. Especially considering Tesla has already developed the Model 3 in 2017, The model electric crossover in 2020, the exoskeleton of the Cybertruck and working on the Semi truck. at this moment we have no idea about Tesla's affordable compact vehicle, which now it looks like may be produced in partnership with Toyota, if this report is true.

I think this is a smart move for both Tesla and Toyota. Some people may be skeptical of a Tesla Toyota partnership, but remember that Tesla helped built Toyota RAV4 in 2012. I am sure you guys remember when Toyota sold its Tesla stocks in 2017.

&#x200B;

**What's in it for Toyota?**

Toyota can also significantly reduce the resources and time spent on innovation of its vehicle's integrated electronic control platform ( ECU ) and operating system ( OS ) by using Tesla technology. Toyota is evaluating that the integrated ECU and OS technology that can control and improve vehicle functions through wireless updates (Over The Air) is lagging behind Tesla. In other words, through cooperation between the two companies, Tesla can reduce the cost and period of developing small electric SUVs and Toyota's benefit is the gain in ECU and OS development. It aims for a win-win effect by reducing the time it takes for the two companies to compensate for each other's weaknesses, allowing them to focus more on their own strengths.

&#x200B;

Tesla and Toyota have previously partnered. The two companies agreed to jointly develop electric vehicles in 2010, and in 2012 marketed Toyota's RAV4 electric vehicle equipped with Tesla's battery system. However, due to various reasons such as poor sales, the alliance between the Toyota and Tesla ended in 2017. Yet, the close relationship between Musk and Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda was maintained, leaving room for a reunion between the two companies in the future.

&#x200B;

Tesla's Fremont Factory is an automobile manufacturing plant in Fremont, California, operated by Tesla. But the facility opened as the General Motors Fremont Assembly in 1962, and was later operated by NUMMI, a former GM–Toyota joint venture. Tesla took ownership in 2010.

&#x200B;

Last year, Toyota sold 9.35 million vehicles, surpassing Volkswagen and returned to the world's top sales in five years. Toyota, along with Isuzu and its truck subsidiary Hino, plans to accelerate the electric and autonomous driving of commercial vehicles. Prior to this, Toyota also established a hydrogen fuel cell development joint venture with five Chinese automobile and technology companies, including Tsinghua University, Beijing, Cheil, Dongfeng, and Guangzhou Motors. The jointly developed hydrogen fuel cell system will be installed on Chinese trucks and buses from 2022. In addition, Toyota is striving to maximize economies of scale related to electrification and autonomous driving, including successive capital alliances with rivals Mazda and Suzuki.

&#x200B;

Meanwhile, Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote on Twitter on the 27th of March that “the likelihood that Tesla will soon become the largest company in the world is higher than 0%.” Although the context is not clear, it was also written “probably within a few months,” an expression that can be interpreted as referring to a period, and was soon deleted. Currently, Tesla's market capitalization is about $ 590 billion, which is one-third of the world's largest market capitalization company, Apple.

&#x200B;

Tesla's share price continued to rise even after surpassing Toyota, which was the first in the industry's market capitalization at the time, in July of last year. Tesla, in particular, has a task to achieve economies of scale, with only 500,000 vehicles sold as of last year. If the alliance with Toyota is established, it can receive great power to expand mass production faster and at lower cost.

Tesla officially makes its charging standard available to other companies in the U.S.,2082,0.96,311,2022-11-12,"Tesla is sharing its EV charging connector design in an effort to encourage network operators and automakers to adopt the technology and help make it the new standard in North America.

Tesla said in a blog post Friday that its design and specification files are available for download. The company said it is “actively working with relevant standards bodies to codify Tesla’s charging connector as a public standard.”

The charging connector in all Tesla vehicles offers AC charging and up to 1 MW DC charging. Its compact design and performance is considered superior to the Combined Charging System (CCS) connectors used by most EVs in North America.

Tesla claims that its charging connector and charge port — which it now calls the North American Charging Standard (NACS) — is the most common charging standard in North America. It’s a stat based on Tesla vehicle sales in North America and the number of chargers at its branded Supercharging stations. Tesla has nearly 1,500 Supercharger stations in the United States. Each station has an average of nine chargers.

Tesla didn’t name any automakers or charging infrastructure companies as converts. In this highly competitive environment, in which virtually every automaker is now using the CCS, it’s hard to see GM, Ford and Stellantis switching to Tesla’s technology.

However, at least one company — EV startup Aptera — supports the move. Earlier this year, Aptera called for the U.S. government to adopt Tesla’s Supercharger technology as the standard for all EV charging in the country. And EVGo has added Tesla connectors to some of its charging stations in the United States.

The company said in the blog post that network operators “already have plans in motion” to incorporate NACS at their chargers. If network providers like ChargePoint, EVConnect or Electrify America add NACS, it would allow Tesla owners to charge at these stations without a need for an adapter.

If automakers switch to NACS on its EVs, it would give owners of those vehicles access to Tesla’s North American Supercharging and destination charging networks.

Tesla wins both primary shareholder resolutions: Elon comp package and reincorporation in TX,479,0.89,347,2024-06-12,"Looks like Tesla won both these resolutions by pretty significant margins.

Is Tesla's stock valuation going to be tied to the success of Twitter?,1222,0.92,573,2022-11-07,"Seeing as Tesla is dropping as bad news is coming out about Twitter, do you think this is this just a coincidence or do you think Tesla's valuation will be tied to the fate of Twitter?

"Tesla (TSLA) PT Lowered to $115 at JPMorgan, 'We are slashing our estimates and price target'",614,0.94,314,2024-04-03,"
On Wednesday, JPMorgan revised its price target for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares, reducing it to $115 from the previous $130 while maintaining an Underweight rating. The adjustment follows Tesla's first-quarter delivery numbers, which significantly fell short of both JPMorgan's and consensus expectations.

Analysts at JPMorgan expressed concern that the disappointing delivery figures might impact investor confidence in Tesla's long-term growth prospects, which is vital for upholding the stock's high valuation multiple.

Tesla's vehicle sales for the first quarter of 2024 showed a year-over-year decline of 9%, contrasting with the Bloomberg consensus estimate which anticipated a growth of 6%, and the company-compiled consensus which expected a 5% increase. This miss represents the largest discrepancy from analyst estimates on record for the electric vehicle maker.

Previously, analysts projected that Tesla would sell 626,000 vehicles in the first quarter, marking a 48% year-over-year growth, but the actual sales reported were only 387,000 vehicles, which is 38% below the peak forecast from June 10, 2022.

In light of these results, JPMorgan has also reduced its estimates for Tesla's first-quarter revenue, now expecting $21.4 billion compared to the previous $25.6 billion, and below the consensus forecast of $23.5 billion. The firm's forecast for earnings per share (EPS) for the first quarter has been lowered to $0.42 from the prior estimate of $0.69, which is also beneath the consensus of $0.61.

The revised EPS forecast is a steep drop from the peak consensus of $1.94 before Tesla implemented a strategy of heavy discounting to boost unit volume in response to softening demand.

Moreover, JPMorgan now anticipates a significant free cash outflow of $1.3 billion for the first quarter, a reversal from its earlier expectation of a $300 million inflow, and contrary to the consensus for a $1 billion inflow. This expectation is based on the assumption of a record increase in finished goods inventory, as Tesla produced 47,000 more vehicles than it sold in the quarter.

This inventory buildup, according to JPMorgan, suggests that the lower deliveries were due to demand constraints rather than supply issues, refuting any implications that disruptions such as the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea or the fire incident at Tesla's Berlin Gigafactory were the primary causes.

JPMorgan warns that Tesla shares, which already saw a 4.9% decline on Tuesday compared to the S&P 500's 0.7% drop, could face further decreases if the company fails to quickly revive unit volume and revenue growth. The firm cautions that investors might reconsider the premium valuation multiple currently assigned to Tesla's stock in the absence of sustained growth.

"Tesla's market share in China falls further from 8.8% to 4.6%, BYD tops with 37.5%",677,0.95,237,2024-05-12,"https://cnevpost.com/2024/05/11/automaker-share-of-china-nev-market-in-apr-2024/

BYD (HKG: 1211, OTCMKTS: BYDDY) continued to dominate China's new energy vehicle (NEV) market in April, with Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) dropping in its ranking.

BYD's retail sales of passenger NEVs in China totaled 254,131 units in April, giving it the No. 1 spot in the NEV market with a 37.5 percent share, according to a ranking released today by the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA).

The NEV maker was the only one with a share of more than 30 percent, with retail sales up 31.1 percent year-on-year.

BYD released figures earlier this month showing it sold 313,245 NEVs in April, up 48.96 percent from a year earlier and up 3.57 percent from March. The figures are wholesale sales and include both passenger cars and commercial vehicles.

China's passenger NEVs sold 674,000 units at retail in April, up 28.3 percent from a year ago but down 5.7 percent from March, CPCA data released yesterday showed.

Tesla's retail sales in China in April were 31,421 units, down 21.4 percent from a year ago, and ranked No. 5 with a 4.6 percent share.

In the CPCA's March retail sales rankings of NEVs released last month, Tesla was No. 2 with an 8.8 percent share, behind BYD's 36.6 percent.

It's worth noting that in China, NEVs include battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and fuel-cell vehicles. BYD produces PHEVs and BEVs, while Tesla only produces BEVs.

Tesla sold 62,167 China-made vehicles in April, including 30,746 exported, according to CPCA data released yesterday.

Tesla has a factory in Shanghai that produces the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover, both for deliveries to local customers and as an export hub for it.

Tesla's pattern is to produce cars for export in the first half of the quarter and for the local market in the second half, it previously said.

Geely's retail sales of NEVs in April were up 76.3 percent at 49,155 units, placing it at No. 2 with a 7.3 percent share.

Changan Automobile's NEV retail sales in April were up 119 percent to 40,507 units, placing it 3rd with a 6 percent share.

In the January-April period, BYD's NEV retail sales were 840,137 units, up 19.6 percent year-on-year, and ranked No. 1 with a 34.3 percent share.

FAW-Volkswagen sold 119,032 units at retail in April, down 15.6 percent year-on-year, and ranked No. 2 with a 7.8 percent share.

Geely had retail sales of 115,723 units in April, up 31.2 percent year-on-year, to take 3rd place with a 7.6 percent share.

In the January-April period, BYD was No. 1 in China's passenger car market with a 13.2 percent share, FAW-Volkswagen was No. 2 with an 8.1 percent share and Geely was No. 3 with a 7.9 percent share.

China NEV retail falls to 674,000 in Apr, penetration reaches record 43.7%."

Elon Musk laid off the Tesla Supercharger team; now he’s rehiring them,786,0.9,187,2024-05-14,"Two weeks ago, Tesla CEO Elon Musk enacted widespread layoffs throughout the company, including the 500-strong team responsible for the brand's Supercharger. Now, Tesla is looking to hire some of them back, Bloomberg reports, as Musk promises to spend $500 million expanding the network.

The Supercharger network is inarguably Tesla's crown jewel. The company recognized early on that, even though its owners slow-charged at home each night, knowing they had the ability to rapidly recharge on the road was critical in making an electric vehicle an acceptable alternative to existing vehicles.

Since then, it has built out more than 2,000 charging stations in the US alone, with more than 25,000 plugs. More than that, the chargers invariably work, something that is often not true for other charging networks.

So successful is the Supercharger network that, over the course of last year, virtually every other automaker that sells or plans to sell EVs in the US has announced it will drop the CCS1 connector for the J3400 standard, originally developed by Tesla. But those announcements were about more than just switching plugs. Each time, the OEM also revealed it had negotiated access for its customers to the Supercharger network.

That made Musk's dismissal of the entire team responsible so hard to fathom. While the Supercharger network accounts for only about 5 percent of Tesla's revenues, that percent is poised to grow as more OEMs gain access. And although the charging experience for Tesla EVs at Superchargers is usually flawless, that's because it's optimized for a single make of car with just five different models; there's no guarantee that will prove true when cars from other brands try to charge.

The layoffs also appeared to put Tesla's plan to build a more powerful charger that would benefit cars using 800 V or 900 V architectures, including Audi, Porsche, Lucid, and others, on hold.

Worse yet, dozens of Supercharger sites that were in the works have stalled out, according to multiple reports.

But last week, Musk announced that Tesla would spend more than $500 million building out more chargers, just days after saying the focus would instead be on uptime at existing locations. And to do that, Tesla will need to rehire a whole bunch of people.

That started with Max de Zegher, who was an executive under the previous head of Supercharging, Rebecca Tinucci. (At the time of the layoffs, Electrek reported that Musk got rid of the entire team because its Tinucci did not lay off enough workers on her own.)

This is not the first time Musk has had to back-track an impetuous business decision. In 2019, he decided to close all of Tesla's retail locations to pay for a cheaper version of the Model 3 sedan. Within two weeks that decision had been reversed, in no small part due to the legal consequences of breaking so many leases.

Top proxy advisor ISS recommends against Elon Musk's $56 billion Tesla pay package ,645,0.93,218,2024-05-31,"Top proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services on Friday recommended Tesla shareholders vote against the re-approval of CEO Elon Musk’s $56 billion pay package and withhold their support from the re-election of News Corp. scion James Murdoch to the automaker’s board.

Tesla’s shareholder meeting is on June 13.

The report, a copy of which was obtained by CNBC, comes after the other influential proxy advisor service, Glass Lewis, also recommended shareholders vote against Musk’s pay package. Tesla’s board is seeking shareholder approval to reinstate Musk’s pay after a Delaware court voided the package earlier this year.

ISS said “cautionary” shareholder support was merited for Tesla’s plans to reincorporate out of Delaware and into Texas, although the proxy advisor also warned that there are concerns over how Tesla’s board decided to reincorporate and over the “unknown” nature of Texas’s business law framework.

The proxy advisor recommended support for some shareholder proposals that Tesla management opposes, including one that would declassify Tesla’s board. A classified or staggered board is considered by some advisors to be an effective defense against a takeover bid.

“At a mega-cap company like Tesla, what is perhaps even more relevant to shareholders is that a staggered board can hinder shareholders from holding directors accountable for poor responsiveness,” ISS said of its support for the declassification proposal.

Pay package push

Tesla has been courting shareholder support in both time-tested and novel ways. The company engaged communications firm FGS Global and proxy solicitor Innisfree M&A to win votes, and has bolstered apparent grassroots support from its large network of social-media influencers. The company also launched a website, VoteTesla.com, and has offered shareholders the chance to win a tour of Tesla’s Gigafactory facility in Austin.

Tesla seeks shareholder approval for Musk’s payday and concurrently to reincorporate out of Delaware and into Texas. The company has characterized the Delaware chancery court ruling that overturned Musk’s stock package as unfriendly to shareholders, noting the value that Musk has created for investors.

“Over the last several years it has become clear that Delaware is no longer the right jurisdiction for us,” Tesla chair Robyn Denholm said in a letter to shareholders earlier this week.

Tesla has adopted tactics other companies have used in contested shareholder meetings, whipping votes and launching a concerted public-relations effort to win support. While Tesla is not facing any sort of meaningful organized opposition to its efforts to reincorporate or re-approve Elon’s pay package, some shareholders have come out against it. Billionaire Leo KoGuan has repeatedly said he will vote against the package. KoGuan says he owns around 0.75% of Tesla shares, worth around $4.9 billion.

Proxy advisor pull

ISS and its smaller peer Glass Lewis are an important factor in how shareholders decide to cast their votes at annual elections. Their recommendations are closely watched in contested situations but are not definitive calls. Still, they have developed a reputation for being important bellwethers and seek to advocate for shareholders.

They’ve also been the direct target of Musk’s ire. Earlier this year on an earnings call, he compared ISS to the terrorist organization ISIL, also known as ISIS. Musk also said they “effectively control the stock market” on X in 2023, saying they had outsize influence over so-called “passive” or institutional shareholders.

Institutional shareholders like BlackRock and Vanguard, however, do not always vote with ISS recommendations. While voting decisions are generally not disclosed until well after a shareholder meeting, those institutional shareholders have due diligence teams that help them decide how to cast the millions of shares they manage on behalf of their investors.

ISS in its report said its prior concerns over the pay package, which dates back to 2018, had not been mitigated and that it “remains excessive,” noting that “the board has effectively only offered shareholders an ‘all or nothing’ option in this vote.”

The proxy advisor alluded to Musk’s myriad other business ventures such as social media platform X, his AI startup xAI and SpaceX, as another reason why Tesla shareholders should not support the pay package.

“The grant, in many ways, failed to achieve the board’s other original objectives of focusing CEO Musk on the interests of Tesla shareholders, as opposed to other business endeavors, and aligning his financial interests more closely with those of Tesla stockholders,” ISS said.

Help me understand how Tesla isn't **insanely** overpriced.,446,0.8,729,2023-12-29,"Hey everyone. I'm trying to wrap my head around why Tesla's stock is so insanely high with the outlook looking not so great. People keep buying it and I can't understand why, other than people are buying it for a long term AI holding. If thats the case, isn't there FAR better stocks to buy?

https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/price-earnings-peg-ratios

Even looking at 2025, the stock still looks very overpriced at a forward PE of 55.4. PEG ratio is 5.11, lol. I don't know that I've seen a PEG ratio that high before.

There's also some headwinds for Tesla. They recently lost the federal tax credit on most of their lineup. This will undoubtedly affect sales and their margins, but admittedly they should remain profitable without the tax credits. IIRC one of the articles I read said that, without the credits, their margin is around 30%, which is still higher than most auto manufacturers. But still, for this company being valued higher than any other auto manufacturer in the world, even ones that sell exponentially more vehicles, I still don't see how the stock price equals reality. 

https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelharley/2023/10/30/5-reasons-why-electric-vehicle-sales-have-slowed/

There has been a slowdown already in electric vehicle sales that will most likely be accelerated by losing the tax credits. Granted that's not all Tesla's fault. We are still a few years away from viable Li-Ion alternatives being ready for mass adoption. Until that happens, the cost of the batteries and rare minerals to make them will remain the biggest hurdle they face. Not to mention hydrogen powered hybrids are slated for mass production starting next year. Electricity rates are constantly increasing. Even if you have a bunch of solar panels, you still paid for that electricity, even if it's cheaper than what you're getting from your utility company. Whereas water is the most abundant resource on the planet. The advantage here does not go for pure electric vehicles IMO.

As far as the AI angle, are they really a competitor when they still only have level 2 autonomous driving? Seems to me like Google would be an infinitely better stock for the AI angle since they are expanding to level 3 and 4 autonomous driving, no? Even if they don't plan on making vehicles, Google seems like the no brainer here and it has very realistic valuations. If im wrong here, please explain why. This post isn't to shit on Tesla stock.

Tesla stock falls more than 5% after hours as Investor Day falls short on detail,1118,0.94,398,2023-03-01,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/01/tesla-2023-investor-day-after-the-bell-master-plan-part-3-teased.html

Electric vehicle maker Tesla hosted a 2023 Investor Day presentation in Austin, Texas, on Wednesday. CEO Elon Musk took the stage to share his “Master Plan 3,” and to discuss how Tesla plans to scale up in the face of increasing competition.

The presentation was long on vision, and included a review of prior achievements, but short on specifics about any new Tesla products or services.

Near the beginning of the presentation, Musk said, “There is a clear path to a sustainable-energy Earth. It doesn’t require destroying natural habitats. It doesn’t require us to be austere and stop using electricity and be in the cold or anything.” He added, “In fact, you could support a civilization much bigger than Earth, much more than the 8 billion humans could actually be supported sustainably on Earth.”

Musk was initially joined on stage by the Senior Vice President of Powertrain and Energy Engineering at Tesla, Drew Baglino. They discussed a future in which the company would play a role in “re-powering the grid with renewable fuels” as they ramp up battery production, both for Tesla’s electric vehicles and for the company’s utility-scale energy storage systems.

Tesla’s goal is to produce 20 million electric vehicles per year by 2030, executives reiterated. The company reported full-year deliveries of around 1.31 million vehicles in 2022.

During a question and answer session following the 3-hour presentation, executives fielded a question about how Tesla could grow its market share in China.

Elon Musk passed the question to Tom Zhu, who is heading up global production and has run the China and APAC businesses for Tesla for years. “As long as you offer a product with value at affordable price you don’t have to worry about demand,” Zhu said. “We try everything to cut costs,” he added, “and pass down that value to our customers.”

Musk then added, “Demand is a function of affordability not desire.” He said, “Even small changes in the price have a big effect on demand.”

Zhu also announced that as of Wednesday, Tesla had produced 4 million cars in total.

“It took us 12 years to build the first million, and about 18 months to the second million. The third million, 11 months. Then less than 7 months to build the 4 millionth,” Zhu said touting the company’s improving operational efficiency.

He said that the company plans to build new car and battery cell factories, and also to produce more cars per year at its existing factories.

Tesla charging leader Rebecca Tinucci said that in 2022 the company provided 9 terawatt hours across charging methods, including home charging including 40,000 Superchargers. (By way of comparison, the entire U.S. consumes about 4,000 terawatt hours of electricity per year.) Tinucci also noted that about half of the company’s Superchargers in the EU are open to other vehicles, and that the company just opened 10 Superchargers in the US to non-Teslas.

Tesla design leader Franz von Holzhausen and vice president of vehicle engineering Lars Moravy took the stage to show off a number of planned manufacturing changes meant to improve the efficiency of Tesla vehicle production. But von Holzhausen said that Tesla would not yet reveal its “next gen” vehicle.

The company’s powertrain vice president, Colin Campbell, said that Tesla’s next powertrain factory will be 50% smaller than the one in Austin, Texas, but will have the same capacity. He also said the company is working on a new kind of drive unit that is compatible with any battery cell type, and a motor that will be built without any rare earth metals.

Ahead of the 2023 Investor Day, at a press conference on Tuesday, Mexico president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Tesla had agreed to build a large factory in Monterrey, Mexico. He said Tesla agreed to use recycled water and take other initiatives to cope with water-scarcity in the region.

Musk confirmed the factory plans on Wednesday, and said production there would supplement, rather than replace, any manufacturing at other Tesla facilities.

Tesla shares have rebounded from declines during 2022, and are up more than 60% for the year so far. However, the stock dropped 1.43% on Wednesday prior to the event, and 5% after hours.

Mizuho Securities analysts maintained a buy rating on shares of Tesla ahead of Investor Day, seeing Tesla in a leadership position in a growing market for fully electric vehicles. They wrote in a note earlier this week, “Near-term, we see continued strength in TSLA’s market share, but see cheaper competitor EVs coming to market as potentially dilutive to TSLA’s share of the US EV market.”

Currently, the lowest-priced Tesla available is the Model 3 sedan, which starts at a price point of around $43,000, they wrote. Seven models from other automakers are currently priced below that, Mizhuo noted.

Musk’s ambitious Master Plan Part Deux was published in 2016, and has not been completely fulfilled. It included four main objectives:

“Create stunning solar roofs with seamlessly integrated battery storage”

“Expand the electric vehicle product line to address all major segments”

“Develop a self-driving capability that is 10X safer than manual via massive fleet learning”

“Enable your car to make money for you when you aren’t using it”."

Elon Musk ordered Nvidia to ship AI chips reserved for Tesla to X and xAI ,573,0.91,220,2024-06-04,"Elon Musk claims he can grow Tesla into “a leader in AI & robotics,” an ambition that he’s said will require a lot of pricey processors from Nvidia to build up its infrastructure.

On Tesla’s first-quarter earnings call in April, Musk said the electric vehicle company will increase the number of active H100s — Nvidia’s flagship artificial intelligence chip — from 35,000 to 85,000 by the end of this year. He also wrote in a post on X a few days later that Tesla would spend $10 billion this year “in combined training and inference AI.”

But emails written by Nvidia senior staff and widely shared inside the company suggest that Musk presented an exaggerated picture of Tesla’s procurement to shareholders. Correspondence from Nvidia staffers also indicates that Musk diverted a sizable shipment of AI processors that had been reserved for Tesla to his social media company X, formerly known as Twitter.

By ordering Nvidia to let privately held X jump the line ahead of Tesla, Musk pushed back the automaker’s receipt of more than $500 million in graphics processing units, or GPUs, by months, likely adding to delays in setting up the supercomputers Tesla says it needs to develop autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots.

“Elon prioritizing X H100 GPU cluster deployment at X versus Tesla by redirecting 12k of shipped H100 GPUs originally slated for Tesla to X instead,” an Nvidia memo from December said. “In exchange, original X orders of 12k H100 slated for Jan and June to be redirected to Tesla.”

A more recent Nvidia email, from late April, said Musk’s comment on the first-quarter Tesla call “conflicts with bookings” and that his April post on X about $10 billion in AI spending also “conflicts with bookings and FY 2025 forecasts.” The email referenced news about Tesla’s ongoing, drastic layoffs and warned that headcount reductions could cause further delays with an “H100 project” at Tesla’s Texas Gigafactory.

The new information from the emails, read by CNBC, highlights an escalating conflict between Musk and some agitated Tesla shareholders who question whether the billionaire CEO is fulfilling his obligations to Tesla while also running a collection of other companies that require his attention, resources and hefty amounts of capital.

A spokesperson for Nvidia declined to comment for this story. Musk and representatives for X and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.

Critics have said Musk is only a part-time CEO of Tesla, the company responsible for the vast majority of his wealth. Musk is also the CEO of aerospace company SpaceX, the founder of brain-computer interface startup Neuralink and tunneling venture The Boring Co. He also owns X, which he acquired for $44 billion in late 2022, when it was still called Twitter. He launched his AI startup, xAI, in 2023.

X and xAI are tightly intertwined. In a post on X in November, Musk wrote, “X Corp investors will own 25% of xAI.” Additionally, xAI uses some capacity in X data centers to run some of its training and inference for the large language models behind its chatbot, called Grok, CNBC has learned.

Musk has pitched Grok, originally named Truth GPT, as a politically incorrect chatbot with “a rebellious streak” and a would-be competitor to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other generative AI services.

While Musk juggles his many ventures, Tesla shareholders have reason for concern. The company is in the midst of a troubling sales decline due in part to its aging lineup of electric vehicles and increased competition. Its reputation has also suffered in the U.S., according to the Axios Harris Poll 100 survey, which attributed some of the slippage to Musk’s “antics” and “political rants.”

Tesla’s stock price is down 29% this year.

Rather than discuss EV sales or the massive restructuring underway at Tesla, Musk has been encouraging investors to focus on future products that he’s been promising for years but has yet to deliver. That includes AI software to turn existing cars into self-driving vehicles, dedicated robotaxis that can make money for their owners, and a driverless transportation network.

“If somebody doesn’t believe Tesla’s going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company,” Musk said on the April earnings call. “We will, and we are.”

To get there, he’s said, Tesla requires plenty of Nvidia’s GPUs which are specialized for AI training and workloads. Those chips are in limited supply due to soaring demand from Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and others.

‘Consuming every GPU that’s out there’

Nvidia, now the third-most-valuable company in the world with a $2.8 trillion market cap, has said it’s hard to keep up with demand. Between the cloud service providers and the companies developing AI models, customers “are consuming every GPU that’s out there,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on an earnings call in May, after the chipmaker reported its third straight quarter of more than 200% revenue growth.

Huang also said, on an earnings call in February, that Nvidia does its best to “allocate fairly and to avoid allocating unnecessarily,” adding “why allocate something when the data center’s not ready?”

In naming customers that are already using Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell platform, Huang mentioned xAI on the May call alongside six of the biggest tech companies on the planet as well as Tesla.

Musk likes to tout his infrastructure spending at both companies.

At Tesla, Musk has promised to build a $500 million “Dojo” supercomputer in Buffalo, New York, and a “super dense, water-cooled supercomputer cluster” at the company’s factory in Austin, Texas. The technology would potentially help Tesla develop the computer vision and LLMs needed for robots and autonomous vehicles.

At xAI, which is racing to compete with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google and others in developing generative AI products, Musk is also seeking to build “the world’s largest GPU cluster” in North Dakota, with some capacity online in June, according to an internal Nvidia email from February.

The memo described a “Musk mandate” to make all 100,000 chips available to xAI by the end of 2024. It noted that the LLM behind xAI’s Grok was relying on Amazon and Oracle cloud infrastructure, with X providing additional data center capacity.

The Information previously reported some details of xAI’s data center ambitions.

On May 26, xAI said it closed a $6 billion financing round led by many of the same investors who funded Musk’s Twitter takeover. The company was incorporated in March 2023, but Tesla didn’t disclose its formation at the time, and it was four months later before Musk publicly introduced the startup.

Conflicts of interest

While Musk has said for years that Tesla is a leader in AI, he wrote in a post on X in January that he’d want more control over the company before pushing further in that direction.

“I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can’t be overturned,” he said in the post.

Tesla’s latest proxy filing indicates Musk has 20.5% of the company’s outstanding shares, a figure that includes options awarded to Musk as part of his unprecedented 2018 CEO pay package. A Delaware court has ordered that compensation to be rescinded. Post-trial proceedings are ongoing and subject to appeal.

If he is unable to reach his desired ownership mark, Musk said in the January post, he “would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.” He’s already doing that at xAI.

Musk’s comments at the time rankled some longstanding bulls, including the company’s largest retail shareholder, Leo Koguan, and Gerber Kawasaki’s Ross Gerber, who characterized his demand as “blackmail.”

Joel Fleming, a securities litigator at Equity Litigation Group, said that by letting his private companies skip ahead of Tesla in procuring critical hardware, Musk is making his conflicts of interest readily apparent.

“When you have someone like Mr. Musk who is a fiduciary to multiple companies, the law recognizes this creates conflict,” Fleming said. “If you owe fiduciary duties to two or more companies that are competing over the same things, you may end up channeling corporate opportunity away from one company to another.”

Fleming, who frequently represents public company investors in shareholder disputes, said that in such situations, other executives would be in the best position to make decisions, while those who are conflicted should abstain.

“That has not historically been the path that Mr. Musk has chosen for himself,” Fleming said.

Musk hasn’t been shy about intermingling corporate resources among his companies.

For example, following his buyout of Twitter, Musk enlisted dozens of Autopilot software engineers and other technical and administrative employees from Tesla to help him make sweeping changes at the company. Some employees even work for two Musk companies at once.

At xAI, Musk has also attracted employees away from Tesla, including machine-learning scientist Ethan Knight, and at least four other former Tesla employees who had been involved in Autopilot and big data projects there before joining the startup.

A former Tesla supply chain analyst, who asked not to be named in order to discuss sensitive matters, told CNBC that Musk has always considered his companies as an extension of his persona and believed he can do whatever he wants with them. That includes Tesla’s 2016 acquisition of SolarCity, where he was chairman and a top shareholder.

However, the person said, redirecting a large shipment of chips from Tesla to X is extreme, given the scarcity of Nvidia’s technology. The decision means the automaker willingly gave up precious time that could have been used to build out its supercomputer cluster in Texas or New York and advance the models behind its self-driving software and robotics.

Tesla Short Sellers Lost $38 Billion in 2020 as Stock Surged,2496,0.96,376,2020-12-31,"https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/tesla-shorts-sellers-lost-38-billion-in-2020-as-stock-surged

With shares up 730%, Tesla bears have seen more than $38 billion in mark-to-market losses this year, according to data from S3 Partners. By comparison, the next-biggest loss for short sellers was on Apple Inc., at just under $7 billion, S3 data shows.

Many of Tesla’s short sellers have closed out their positions over the course of 2020, with short interest falling to 6% of the float from nearly 20% a year ago, according to S3 data.

The next potential catalyst comes in early January, when Tesla reports fourth-quarter vehicle production and delivery figures. Tesla expects to deliver half a million cars in 2020, a huge milestone for a company that initially struggled to mass-produce its Model 3 and is now building additional factories in Berlin and Austin, Texas.

Thanks for the award."

Tesla cuts Model 3 and Model Y prices in the U.S. after car deliveries fall - CNBC,637,0.93,431,2023-10-06,"[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/06/tesla-cuts-model-3-model-y-prices-in-the-us-after-deliveries-fall.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/06/tesla-cuts-model-3-model-y-prices-in-the-us-after-deliveries-fall.html)   


* Tesla cut the price of some Model 3 and Model Y versions in the U.S. after the company reported third-quarter deliveries that missed market expectations.
* The starting price for the Model 3 is listed at $38,990 on Tesla’s website, down from $40,240 previously.
* The latest round of price cuts comes just days after Tesla reported third-quarter deliveries of 435,059 vehicles, missing analyst expectations and marking a decline from the previous quarter

Tesla cut the price of some Model 3 and Model Y versions in the U.S. after the company reported third-quarter deliveries that missed market expectations.  
  
The starting price for the Model 3 is listed at $38,990 on Tesla’s website, down from $40,240 previously. The long range Model 3 fell from $47,240 to $45,990. And the Model 3 Performance fell to $50,990 from $53,240.  
  
Tesla’s Model Y Performance sports utility vehicle now starts at $52,490, down from a previous price of $54,490.

Beginning at the end of last year, Tesla began cutting the prices of its cars across the world in a bid to stoke demand amid concerns over slowing consumer spending in markets like the U.S. and China and as competition in the electric vehicle space ramped up."
Tesla stock pops after plans to enable another stock split,1169,0.95,624,2022-03-28,"Shares of shot up Monday, after the electric vehicle giant disclosed plans to enable a stock split, which would be the second in two years.

The company TSLA, -0.32% said in an 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it will ask shareholders to approve an increase in the number of shares outstanding. The request will be made at its 2022 annual shareholders meeting expected in October.

The stock rallied 5.8% in premarket trading, putting them on track to open at the highest price seen during regular-session hours since Jan. 13. It slipped 0.3% on Friday to close at $1,010.64, to snap an eight-day winning streak. Monday’s rally comes even after a report that Tesla will pause production in China amid new COVID-19 lockdowns.

Tesla had 1.033 billion shares outstanding as of Jan. 31. In the 2021 proxy statement, the company said it is authorized to have 2.00 billion shares outstanding.

The company’s only other stock split, a 5-to-1 split, took effect on Aug. 31, 2020. At that time, the stock was trading at a pre-split-adjusted price of about $2,213. The stock closed Aug. 31 at split-adjusted $498.32.

To lower the stock price to around that level, Tesla would have to increase number of shares it is authorized to have outstanding by more than 1 billion, so it could enact a 2-for-1 split. To match the previous 5-for-1 split, the number of authorized shares outstanding would have to increase by more than 3 billion.

Although a stock split doesn’t change anything about a companies fundamentals, it has historically helped boost the stock price as it is viewed as a sign of management’s confidence that the stock will continue to perform well, as Mark Hulbert has written for MarketWatch.

Tesla’s stock had soared 78% from the time the company said after the Aug. 11 close that it approved a 5-for-1 stock split through Aug. 31, but then fell 33.7% over the next week. The stock didn’t close back above the Aug. 31 closing price until Nov. 19.

Tesla’s stock has lost 4.4% year to date through Friday, but has soared 63.4% over the past 12 months. In comparison, the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.51% has gained 14.3% over the past year.

“With 180k for 4Q the line in the sand, we believe given the underlying strength we are picking up in China as well as a late push in Europe and the U.S., that 190k-200k is well within reach,” Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a commentary.

He added that “while there are some logistics speed bumps throughout Europe that could derail a number of deliveries in the next few days, the theme of the Tesla story and overall global EV demand continues to be around white hot demand coming out of China.”

Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy also has a neutral rating on Tesla, with a $400 price target. He forecasts 183,000 deliveries this quarter, above what he sees as the sell-side consensus for 163,000 and the likely buy-side consensus for 175,000 to 180,000 deliveries. That would take Tesla to 502,000 deliveries for 2020 as a whole.

"Tesla cuts prices nearly $2,000 in China, in line with U.S. cuts",645,0.94,186,2024-04-21,"Tesla has cut prices by nearly $2,000 across its models in China, after price cuts in the United States, as it grapples with falling sales and an intensifying price war for electric vehicles (EVs), especially against cheaper Chinese EVs.

Elon Musk’s EV maker cut the starting price of the revamped Model 3 in China by 14,000 yuan ($1,930) to 231,900 yuan, its official website showed on Sunday.

Tesla made similar cuts to the Model Y starting price, now 249,900 yuan, the regular version of the Model S to 684,900 yuan and the Model S Plaid to 814,900 yuan. The regular Model X now costs 724,900 yuan and its plaid variant 824,900 yuan.

The carmaker on Friday cut U.S. prices of its Model Y, Model X and Model S vehicles by $2,000. On Saturday it slashed the price of its Full Self-Driving driver assistant software to $8,000 from $12,000 in the United States.

Tesla reported this month that its global vehicle deliveries in the first quarter fell for the first time in nearly four years, as price cuts failed to stir demand.

The EV maker has been slow to refresh its ageing models as high interest rates have sapped consumer appetite for big-ticket items, while rivals in China, the world’s largest auto market, are rolling out cheaper models.

Musk postponed a planned trip this weekend to India, where he was to have met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, citing obligations at Tesla. The trip was to have included the announcement of plans for Tesla to enter the South Asian market, Reuters has reported on Saturday.

Musk said last Monday that Tesla will lay off more than 10% of its global workforce as the automaker is bracing for its first annual drop in deliveries.

The announcement came after Reuters reported on April 5 that Tesla had scrapped its plan to develop its long-awaited affordable EV in favour of robotaxis. Musk posted that “Reuters is lying” after the report, without citing any inaccuracies. He has not spoken further about the model, leaving investors clamouring for clarity.

Tesla shares fell 40.8% so far this year.

Since late 2022, Tesla ignited a price war as Musk pursued volume growth at the expense of margins.

A deep dive into who actually buys Teslas,971,0.86,735,2022-05-22,"It seems to be a common assumption around here that Musk’s latest political tweets could alienate Tesla’s main customer base: democrats. But instead of debating about whether or not that’s true, let’s first look at if it’s even accurate to assume that most Tesla buyers are democrats.

Luckily, theres data for that and the results were disclosed in Feb ‘22. [Leta take a look at the key findings of that survey.](https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/03/cars/tesla-buyer-politics/index.html) Keep in mind, these results came out long before his latest claim to be voting Republican. 

First finding: “Surveys by research firm Morning Consult show that in January about 22% of Democrats were considering buying a Tesla, while 17% of Republicans were looking to purchase one”

Second: “And Republicans are slightly more likely to trust the Tesla brand, 27% compared to 25% among Democrats.”

Okay so far it’s looking pretty equal today. But how about in the past?

Third: “Data from Strategic Vision, which has surveyed hundreds of thousands of car buyers, shows that since 2019, 38% of Tesla buyers have identified themselves as Democrats, and 30% have said they're Republicans. That's slightly less ""liberal"" than EV buyers overall, who skew 41% Democratic to 27% Republican.”

So definitely a higher percentage being democrat. But far from the majority. 

And I saved the best for last: “Figures from the Internal Revenue Service show that only 22% of those claiming the credit had adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less, while 32% earned between $100,000 and $200,000, and another 43% earned between $200,000 and $500,000. The remaining 4% earned more than $1 million.”

So Tesla buyers are rich. Though this data is only from people who were able to claim the $7,500 credit which as been long gone.

And lastly: “The primary motivator to buy a Tesla is not because customers want to reduce greenhouse gases, Edwards said. His data show performance and styling are the biggest draws for most buyers.”

My conclusion: It seems to me like whether someone is a democrat or not isn’t as much of a factor as Reddit assumes. Having enough money to buy one is. As is Tesla maintaining its “cool factor”.

Edit: since the income numbers are a little wonky and outdated, I’ve found one that is more current [here](https://hedgescompany.com/blog/2019/03/tesla-model-3-demographics-income/). It looks like the average household income of a model 3 is $134,000 as of 2022. So still a lot but not as crazy as the other numbers made it seem."
Robotaxis are here and the public is divided. Alphabet owned Waymo is the leader in the space. Tesla’s upcoming robotaxi launch.,190,0.81,261,2024-10-07,"Driverless cars are speeding onto America’s streets, but whether the public will trust robotaxis remains an open question. 

Nearly two-thirds of Americans said they would not want to ride in a driverless passenger vehicle if they had the opportunity, according to a Pew Research Center Survey. That’s because residents in cities that have yet to experience robotaxis remain unfamiliar with the technology while those in cities with driverless cabs have not yet forgotten about high-profile accidents involving other companies, like GM-owned Cruise. 

Now Tesla, the loudest and most bullish self-driving proponent of them all, is due to unveil its long-awaited robotaxi after years of unfulfilled promises.

The company’s existing autonomous driving technology, where a human is still at the wheel, has drawn the scrutiny of regulators and multiple lawsuits after hundreds of crashes. Experts say a great presentation from CEO Elon Musk won’t guarantee a safe robotaxi network.

Tesla’s upcoming robotaxi launch threatens to throw the whole autonomous vehicle space off course. 

Alphabet-owned Waymo is the leader in the space, with the company claiming it has notched more than 22 million driverless miles. It has proven that there is strong consumer demand, with weekly paid rides in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Austin doubling in just a couple months. And Waymo has worked on building its reputation, launching an online safety hub with data arguing that its cars are safer than human drivers.

Besides Tesla, other competitors are also looking to jump into the race.

Amazon says it is getting ready to roll out its fleet of Zoox cars, and Cruise is resuming operations after a 2023 accident led regulators to ground the fleet. Wall Street is already looking ahead to a driverless future, with one analyst arguing that if it hadn’t been for generative AI, 2024 would have been the year of the robotaxi. 

As driverless networks scale, one of the fiercest debates is whether ride-sharing will survive. Robotaxis may cause consumers to question if they really want to book an Uber or Lyft and talk to a stranger, sit in someone else’s car and tip a human if there is a driverless alternative. Uber has hedged its bets by inking high-profile deals with autonomous vehicle companies, but it’s unclear how long those partnerships will last."
Lemon-Musk interview: Musk teases Tesla flying cars w/ SpaceX. Stock is up 6%. Are flying cars baked in the stock price?,370,0.75,383,2024-03-18,"""*Billionaire Elon Musk has teased the possibility of producing a commercially-available flying car as the next generation of Tesla vehicles.*

*In an interview with journalist Don Lemon released in full on Monday morning, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO was asked about the new model of the Roadster—the car manufacturer's original design—which is due to be released next year. ""Look, I don't want to give away much more than what I've said publicly, except that the Roadster will be a collaboration between SpaceX and Tesla—so you can expect some rocket-y stuff there,"" he said.*  
*Asked by Lemon if it could be a flying car, Musk responded: ""Maybe,"" before waggling his head and laughing. ""It's not out of the question. I've got to reserve the cool stuff for when we actually unveil it, but it's going to be really cool; it's going to have some rocket technology in it.""*

*He added: ""I think, really, the only way to do something that's cooler than the Cybertruck is to combine SpaceX and Tesla technology to create something that's not ever really a car.""*

*""Then what would it be?"" Lemon asked.*

*""Something that's never existed before,"" Musk said, before agreeing with Lemon that it would have ""Jetsons vibes,"" a reference to the space age Hanna-Barbera cartoon which features flying cars.*

***The Context***:

*Tesla would not be the first company to attempt to build a commercially viable flying car. Several start-ups have been making use of advances in electric vehicle technology in recent years to design vehicles that hope to live up to science fiction.*

*Most recently, San Mateo, California-based start-up Alef previously told Newsweek its prototype—which received Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) approval for testing last year, and operates using a hollow body and internal rotors—was in the works. The company said pre-orders for the $300,000 vehicle had surged since the start of 2023.*

*However, no company has so far been able to secure regulatory approval for a flying road car, which would come with safety requirements and considerations that ground-based vehicles do not have to meet. For Tesla to bring a flying car to market, it would need FAA certification under the agency's adapted regulatory framework.""*

***What We Know***:

*Musk has previously teased the collaboration between his two companies in a June 2018 post on X, formerly Twitter—a platform which he now also owns.*

*At the time, he said the electric sports car would have a SpaceX-designed optional package that would include around ""10 small rocket thrusters arranged seamlessly around \[the\] car"" that would ""dramatically improve acceleration, top speed, braking & cornering. Maybe they will even allow a Tesla to fly...""*

*In 2019, he wrote that the new model would be able to go from zero to 60 miles per hour in 2.1 seconds ""before adding \[the\] rocket thruster option.""*

*Then late last month, Musk wrote on X that he had ""radically increased the design goals for the new Tesla Roadster,"" adding: ""There will never be another car like this, if you could even call it a car.""*

"Elon Musk says Tesla deliveries will rise 30% to 40% in 2020, touts new battery tech",1942,0.94,461,2020-09-22,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Tuesday he expects vehicle deliveries to increase by 30 to 40 percent over last year, when the company reported deliveries of 367,500 vehicles. The new guidance from Musk implies deliveries of between 477,750 and 514,500 cars, a range that encompasses the company’s previously stated goal to deliver half a million cars in 2020.

Musk offered the updated numbers during the company’s 2020 shareholder’s meeting on Tuesday afternoon, which was accompanied by a presentation about Tesla’s battery advances. After thanking Tesla owners for their word-of-mouth marketing, he noted: 


“In 2019, we had 50% growth. And I think we’ll do really pretty well in 2020, probably somewhere between 30 to 40 percent growth, despite a lot of very difficult circumstances.”

The company’s shares dropped more than 6% during the presentation, which took place after normal trading hours.

During the “battery day” portion of the presentation, Tesla confirmed that it is making its own battery cells at a facility in Fremont.

Joining Musk on stage, Tesla’s senior vice president of powertrain and energy engineering, Drew Baglino, described the new cells as a “large tabless cell,” with a “shingled spiral” design. The cells are larger than the ones Tesla purchases from Panasonic and other suppliers, and offer “thermal benefits” which make them appropriate for use in electric vehicles. 

Baglino said battery, manufacturing and design changes underway at Tesla would eventually “unlock” a 54% improvement in the range of the company’s vehicles.

Musk, who is famous for being overly optimistic on such matters, said with all the battery and manufacturing advances Tesla is working on: “About 3 years from now, we’re confident we can make a very compelling $25,000 electric vehicle that’s also fully autonomous.” 

Near-term, Tesla says it aims to produce 10 gigawatt hours worth of its new battery cells at its pilot plant within a year. Musk noted that whatever cells it produces in Fremont would be supplemental to 100 gigawatt hours worth of cells it buys from suppliers. The company also said it had secured rights to a lithium clay deposit in Nevada to mine for its batteries.

On Monday, Musk warned that the advances announced at battery day won’t find their way into mass production until 2021, sending the company’s stock down about 6% ahead of the event on Tuesday.

Due partly to Covid-19 health orders that limit the size of in-person gatherings, Tesla postponed its annual meeting from July this year to Sept. 22, 2020. The company previously held its shareholder meetings at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California but moved the event to Fremont, where its U.S. vehicle assembly plant is based. Shareholders parked and sat in their cars at the meeting, which Musk characterized as a “drive-in.” They honked in lieu of applause.

Those who wanted to attend had to obtain a winning lottery-style ticket (or other special access) to the meeting. Otherwise, shareholders could log into a website to ask questions to be answered during the live-streamed event.

Since its last shareholder meeting in June 2019, Tesla’s long-time CTO JB Straubel resigned from the company. He worked there from the start, even before Musk took the CEO reins in 2008.

Tesla also appointed a new board member, Hiromichi Mizuno, formerly the Chief Investment Officer of the Japan Government Pension Investment Fund, and a famous critic of shortsellers. Long-time Elon Musk collaborator and proponent, venture capitalist Steve Jurvetson, is leaving the Tesla board as well, though he still sits on the board of Musk’s aerospace venture, SpaceX.

Remaining board members at Tesla authorized a five-for-one stock split, which the company implemented in August this year. The split followed four consecutive quarters of reported profitability for Tesla, and a season where Musk clashed with health authorities in California over Covid-19 restrictions that temporarily shut down their vehicle assembly plant in Fremont.

The stock split also followed a huge payout to Musk, part of his unprecedented compensation package. 

Expecting Tesla to talk about where its metals for batteries are sourced, and to promote battery tech suitable for Semi and Cybertruck vehicles, Cannacord Genuity analyst Jed Dorsheimer wrote in a note to investors before the meeting:

“The big question will be on follow through. It’s one thing to announce all these breakthroughs, which might be great for momentum algorithms, but like most things TSLA, the devil will be in the details, which sadly will take some time to play out.”

Cannacord maintains a “Hold” rating and a price target of $442 on shares of Tesla currently.

Shares of the electric car maker are up more than 400% year-to-date.

"Tesla further delays Cybertruck timeline to late 2022, Roadster delayed until 2023",1398,0.96,510,2021-09-03,"The Tesla Cybertruck delay was already a known fact, but CEO Elon Musk's latest reported comments add a few more details to the picture. Citing sources familiar with the meeting, Electrek reported Thursday that Musk held a company-wide call and said the Cybertruck should be ready for production in late 2022.

If the company plans for beta trucks later this year, that leaves nowhere near enough time to start actual production in late 2021.

Following his comments, Tesla updated the Cybertruck's reservation page to note production will fire up in 2022. Though, according to Musk, we're not looking at early 2022 or anything like that. And as we suspected, the CEO underscored the electric truck's volume models may not be ready until sometime in 2023. If Tesla follows this timeline, we'll get the priciest tri-motor model in 2022, then the dual- and single-motor trucks in 2023.

Elon Musk confirmed that Tesla has delayed the new Roadster program to 2023, and even then, that’s only going to happen with a big “if.”  
The new electric hypercar is now three years behind its original timeline.  
When first unveiling the next-generation Tesla Roadster in 2017, Musk said that it will come to market in 2020.

Tesla started taking reservations for the impressive electric supercar with a 0-60 mph in 1.9 seconds and over 600 miles of range at the unveiling event.  
People who wanted to be first in line to get the vehicle had to put down between $50,000 and $250,000 in deposits.  
The vehicle program was later delayed, as the CEO said that it wasn’t a priority for Tesla.

"Tesla delivers 241,300 cars in Q3 2021",1231,0.93,603,2021-10-02,"Tesla has bucked the wider trend of declining sales brought on by the global chip shortage in the third quarter this year, as it sold 241,300 cars — a total of 102,000 more vehicles than the same quarter last year. It’s the most Tesla has ever sold in a quarter (and for some added perspective, the company [sold 367,500 in all of 2019](https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/3/21047233/tesla-2019-deliveries-q4-record-model-3-sales)).

The company managed to deliver more vehicles once again despite the fact that major automakers saw huge drops this past quarter. General Motors, the largest automaker in the US, said [Friday morning](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2021/10/01/gm-sales-chip-shortage-suv/5934699001/) that it only sold 446,997 vehicles in the third quarter — a 33 percent drop from the same period last year.

Tesla has avoided similar problems in part because it has been [sourcing different semiconductors and rewriting software on the fly](https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560608/tesla-q2-2021-deliveries-elon-musk) to make those chips work in place of the ones not currently available. Beyond that, the company continues to see strong sales in China, where it started making and selling vehicles in early 2020. The Model Y SUV has also become a popular option in the United States, and Tesla [just started selling them in Europe, too](https://electrek.co/2021/08/23/tesla-tsla-starts-model-y-deliveries-europe/).

Edit: If Tesla increases production by another 73% by Q3 2022 they will be producing 416,000 vehicles a quarter. If GM sells only 6.5% less vehicles Q3 of next year than Tesla and GM will have the same production numbers. Something to keep in mind.

"Elon Musk’s tweets about taking Tesla private in 2018 were false, new court filing says",1424,0.89,340,2022-04-17,"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/16/elon-musk-funding-secured-tweets-ruled-false-new-court-filing-suggests.html

In a court filing out late Friday, shareholders who are suing Tesla and CEO Elon Musk over alleged securities fraud said they won part of a critical ruling in their class-action lawsuit. The shareholders are suing Tesla over money they lost after Musk tweeted in 2018 that he was considering taking his electric vehicle company private at $420 per share and said he had funding secured to do so. Tesla’s stock trading initially halted, then shares were highly volatile for weeks after the tweets. Musk later said that he had been in discussions with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund and felt confident that funding would come through at his proposed price. A deal never materialized. The Securities and Exchange Commission investigated and charged Musk with civil securities fraud as a result of those tweets. Tesla and Musk struck a revised settlement agreement in 2019 over those charges, but Musk is trying to terminate that agreement now.

Damages from the shareholders’ class-action lawsuit could amount to billions of dollars that would be paid by Musk and Tesla to those who are members of the class. The shareholders’ attorneys said in the filing out Friday that Judge Edward M. Chen, who is presiding in this matter, had concluded that Musk acted with scienter — in other words, that he knowingly made false statements about having funding secured when he tweeted. This information was revealed in a request the shareholders’ lawyers made for a temporary restraining order against Musk to stop him from making further public remarks about aspects of this case, as he did during a widely viewed appearance at the TED 2022 conference on April 14. Musk also said, “The SEC knew that funding was secured but they pursued an active, public investigation nonetheless at the time. Tesla was in a precarious financial situation. And I was told by the banks that if I did not agree to settle with the SEC that they would, the banks would cease providing working capital and Tesla would go bankrupt immediately. So that’s like having a gun to your child’s head. I was forced to concede to the SEC unlawfully.” 

It’s not clear why Musk felt he may have been unable to obtain working capital for Tesla, but confident he could muster the billions required to take the company private at the same time. Musk is currently the richest person in the world on paper, and is trying to acquire Twitter, his social media platform of choice, and take it private for around $43 billion. Musk’s attorney Alex Spiro, a partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, said in a statement emailed to CNBC: “Nothing will ever change the truth which is that Elon Musk was considering taking Tesla private and could have - all that’s left some half decade later is random plaintiffs’ lawyers trying to make a buck and others trying to block that truth from coming to light all to the detriment of free speech.”"

Tesla Falls Most Since June as Quarterly Deliveries Disappoint,1058,0.96,400,2022-10-03,"Tesla Inc.’s shares dropped the most in three months after the carmaker blamed a disappointing deliveries report on shipment issues that increased the number of vehicles that were on their way to customers as the quarter came to a close.

The maker of Model 3 sedans and Model Y crossovers handed over 343,830 vehicles to customers in the last three months, short of the almost 358,000 total that analysts expected. The stock fell 8.2% at 11:20 a.m. in New York, the biggest intraday decline since June 16.

Tesla has for years delivered big batches of vehicles toward the end of each quarter, a practice Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has tried to move away from by localizing production in all major regions. While the carmaker opened its first European factory in Germany in March, record shipping costs are still bedeviling the auto industry along with shortages of semiconductors and other components.

Elon Musk says he’s ‘sold enough’ Tesla stock to satisfy his 10% goal,1110,0.9,613,2021-12-22,"Elon Musk said Tuesday he’s met his goal of selling 10% of his stake in Tesla Inc., and criticized California for “overtaxation.” In a nearly hourlong podcast interview with the satirical website the Babylon Bee, the Tesla TSLA, +4.29% CEO said: “I sold enough stock to get to around 10% plus the option-exercise stuff, and I tried to be extremely literal here.”

According to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Musk exercised 2 million more options and sold nearly 584,000 more Tesla shares Tuesday, bringing the total number of shares sold over the past month-plus to about 13.5 million — slightly shy of the roughly 17 million shares that constituted his 10% stake as of Nov. 7, when he posted a Twitter poll asking whether he should sell. He’s made more than $14 billion in those sales. But over that time he’s also exercised options to buy about 16.4 million stock options at about $6.24 a share, actually increasing his stake in the electric-auto maker.

Musk also tweeted Sunday night that he will pay more than $11 billion in taxes this year. That equates to about 8.06 million of his recently sold shares going to his tax bill on stock options set to expire next year. Musk, who has insulted top Democrats in recent weeks who have called for him to pay more in taxes, took a parting shot at California’s high taxes.

“California used to be the land of opportunity and now it is… becoming more so the land of sort of overregulation, overlitigation, overtaxation,” he told the Babylon Bee.

This year, Musk moved his residence and Tesla’s corporate headquarters from California to Texas, which has significantly lower taxes. Musk is the world’s wealthiest individual according to Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index, with a fortune of about $245 billion — up nearly $89 billion this year alone. In Tuesday’s podcast, Musk reiterated that his wealth is tied up in stock. “It’s not like I’ve got some sort of massive cash balance,” he said. Tesla shares gained more than 4% Tuesday and are up 33% year to date. The company’s stock has soared more than 1,100% over the past three years.

Tesla Semi doubts,640,0.79,772,2022-12-01,"Tesla Semi *delivery* event has happened, the first delivery actually happened yesterday to Pepsi. 

500 mile range at 82,000 lbs real world test. Right off the factory line, onto the road. There was no aero package added and no weight change, and the truck only stopped once so the driver could use the bathroom. 

During this real world test, brakes were actually cold at the mandatory brake check on route. Which is in place so drivers that normally would have extremely hot brakes don’t end up experiencing brake failures due to high temperatures. This is because the regenerative brake system on the Tesla semi works extremely well, to the point where the brakes are almost not needed. Think of it kind of like an engine brake on a diesel truck, but instead of just slowing down the truck it now also charges the battery. 

Price was not discussed, weight was not discussed. 

It’s clear that this will operate extremely well on shorter routes with its current range, but will not be as useful on larger trips. The argument can be made that laws don’t allow drivers to drive continuously without breaks, but the Semi is still a little short even with these breaks accounted for. I imagine as battery density gets better this will change. Along with the fact that these electric semi (on paper) will be *far* cheaper to operate, possibly offsetting downtime (charging time) costs. 

Over the average lifetime of a Semi, Tesla semi can save $600k to a million+ just in fuel. (Depending on charging rates) That doesn’t account for possible (and highly likely) maintenance cost savings. 

TLDR: Tesla Semi is a beast and obvious choice for anything under the ~500 mile routes, as routes get longer more consideration will be needed. 

Also to all the doubters, Tesla may be late, wrong, or seem completely insane sometimes but I think it’s fair to say that they do deliver."
'Safety Disaster:' Tesla FSD 'Galaxies Away From Being Anywhere Close To Competition',261,0.79,185,2024-09-27,"* Tesla's FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised, is now the core technology behind the robotaxi service the company plans to launch.
* Most analysts assign hefty value for the FSD technology alone.

  
With just two weeks to go for Tesla, Inc.’s TSLA Robotaxi unveil event, an analyst painted a bleak picture of the company’s self-driving technology.



**What Happened**: Tesla’s FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised FSD, is a “safety disaster” and “galaxies away from being anywhere close to the competition,” said GLJ Research’s Gordon Johnson in a note. Tesla’s competitors in this arena are Alphabet, Inc.’s GOOGL GOOG Waymo and General Motors Corp.’s GM Cruise.



With Tesla eyeing the rollout of its Fully Supervised FSD in China, the Elon Musk-led company would be up against domestic player Baidu, Inc.’s BIDU Apollo Go.



Johnson referenced reviews by two sources to make his case. Independent lab AMCI Testing, which tried the technology, said the overall performance of Tesla’s camera-enabled autonomous-driving software is “suspect.” In a report released on Tuesday, the firm said its evaluation showed how often human intervention was required for safe operation. “In fact, our drivers had to intervene over 75 times during the evaluation; an average of once every 13 miles,” it said.



While the FSD 12.5.1 was impressive, it is incredibly dangerous for drivers operating with FSD to drive with their hands in their laps or away from the steering wheels, it said. “The most critical moments of FSD miscalculation are split-second events that even professional drivers, operating with a test mindset, must focus on catching,” it added.



Johnson also referred to data from [Teslafsdtracker.com](http://Teslafsdtracker.com), which aggregates TSLA FSD driving experiences/data, in real-time from users, which shows that the latest iteration of FSD has a **critical disengagement every 130 miles and every 72 miles when driven in a city.**

  
Data reported by competitors to the California Department of Motor Vehicles show that miles to disengagement data for various players are as follows:

* Waymo: 17,311 miles
* **Amazon, Inc.’s** AMZN Zoox: 177,602 miles
* [Pony.Ai](http://Pony.Ai) (startup): 17,077 miles
* WeRide (startup): 21,191 miles

The **metric for Tesla is 13 miles**, based on AMCI’s statistics, Johnson said, although Tesla doesn’t yet report data to California DMV, given its FSD tech is **only Level 2.**  


**Why It’s Important:** Johnson noted that many sell-side analysts assign a valuation of $300 billion to $600 billion for Tesla’s FSD technology. In real-time, the value is close to zero, he said, adding that it could be negative, given the “liability of putting something this dangerous on roads.”

  
According to Ark’s valuation model, by 2029, robotaxis, which has FSD as its core technology, would account for 63% of Tesla’s revenue and 86% of EBITDA.

Future Fund LLC Managing Partner Gary Black, a Tesla bull, said in a recent post on X that Tesla's FSD is not yet close to the 99.99% efficacy needed for unsupervised autonomy.

We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),355,0.76,547,2023-10-29,"\*\* I have no position that is impacted by this post\*\*

Over the past few years, TSLA has performed nothing short of extraordinary. In the last five years, Tesla stock has almost 10x its value. The 857% total return of Tesla is substantially higher than all of its peers, including Ford, Toyota, and Volkswagen

Despite strong growth, weakness has begun to present itself within the Wall Street prince in the past year. Tesla announced earlier in February 2023 that it would be cutting prices on the Model Y. This move surprised investors because, before the price cuts, Tesla appeared to be entirely supply-side constrained. However, investors noted that these cuts only impacted higher-end models that were outside the range of the mass vehicle market. However, in April, Tesla announced that it would be cutting prices on the Model 3. Elon Musk has previously alluded to a poor performing EV market in the wake of a higher interest rate environment. Economic data confirms this narrative as Automobile shipments have declined substantially in Q3’ 2023.

However, two factors that cannot be explained by an adverse economic environment are Full Self-Driving (FSD) and Cybertruck demand. FSD is Tesla’s end-to-end autonomous driving solution.

Tesla’s FSD is considered a level 2 autonomous driving solution. Level 2 systems require the driver to remain alert at all times with the anticipation that driver will have to take over in every circumstance. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly claimed that FSD would be finished by the end of the year for the past six years. Additionally, Musk has claimed that robo-taxis, completely automated taxi services would be available during the same timeframes. Tesla’s current FSD beta boasts some impressive technologies, including the ability to navigate through city streets without immediate intervention in many cases. However, level 3 seems to be uncertain  for the car company. On the other hand, Tesla’s competitors such as Waymo, Mobileye, and Cruise have all operated in some capacity at level 3 or level 4. In particular, Mobileye has proved to be a serious threat to FSD due to its goal of integrating in Tesla’s competitors. Mobileye has outlined several technologies that are set to compete with Tesla’s current offerings as well as Tesla’s future capabilities.

The Cybertruck further highlights Tesla’s habit of misleading shareholders. The Cybertruck is Tesla’s consumer pickup truck expected to be launched in Q4 2023. In Tesla’s Q2 2023 earnings call, Musk stated that Cybertruck demand is, ""so off the hook, you can’t even see the hook.” EV insider reported that this statement was likely to transfer into 1.9 million preorders. However, Tesla failed to mention that the Cybertruck’s preorder deposit was $100. In Tesla’s Q3 earnings call, Musk stated that “We dug our own grave” when referring to Cybertruck. He noted that he expects it to be 18 months before Cybertruck is cash flow positive, adding another timeline onto a timeline full of delays. Musk still sees demand surpassing one million units. However, it seems unlikely that demand will be that high, considering high interest rate environment and mere $100 commitment by prospective buyers."
Tesla Is Now Worth $400 Billion,1493,0.96,497,2020-08-26,"The world’s most valuable car company just hit another milestone.

Tesla ￼’s (ticker: TSLA) market capitalization on Wednesday topped $400 billion. About two months ago, it was celebrating $200 billion. It first hit $100 billion in January.

Tesla passed Johnson & Johnson ￼ (JNJ) along the way on Wednesday, in terms of market cap. There are only seven companies in the S&P 500 index worth more, including Visa ￼ (V) at $447 billon and Apple ￼ (AAPL) at $2.16 trillion.

There is a lot you could buy for $400 billion. Here are a few notable   comparisons to put that figure in context.

It’s more than the combined value of every team in the four major U.S. professional sports, according to Forbes estimates. It’s also more than the Forbes estimate for the combined net worth of Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Tesla’s own CEO Elon Musk.

It’s nearly four times International Business Machines ￼’ (IBM) market cap.

You could buy 400 billion things at a dollar store—or just buy Dollar General ￼ (DG) and Dollar Tree ￼ (DLTR).

It’s also more than the individual gross domestic product of Israel, Ireland, and Hong Kong.

With $400 billion, you could also stockpile about 181 billion regular gallons of gas, based on AAA’s U.S. estimates. You could drive 5.79 trillion miles, if you averaged 32 miles per gallon. That would take you around the Earth 232.5 million times.

If you are into electric vehicles, $400 billion could get you 10.53 million of Tesla’s basic 2020 Model 3. Of course, such a sale would cause price targets to soar. And Tesla would need a few more factories to turn out that many vehicles. The company only delivered about 90,000 vehicles in the second quarter.

On Tesla's valuation,870,0.88,753,2021-10-30,"Tesla's valuation is probably one of the most hotly debated topics in the stock market these past few years. Tesla is certainly richly valued, and sentiments like ""Tesla has a higher market cap than all other automakers combined"" or ""Tesla has decades of growth priced in"" are very prevalent, especially on this sub.

That said, I noticed a trend where - although lots of different people are saying this and people defending Tesla's market cap are often downvoted - the people who make this argument never use any numbers to back up their claims. So I figured it might be nice to have an objective look at Tesla's trends and projections, run the numbers, and see how richly valued Tesla really is.

**For those who don't like reading, I will now explain how I got to my numbers. If you don't like reading, skip straight to ""The Numbers""**

----------------------------

**The method**

While trailing P/E numbers are generally quite meaningless for companies that are growing as fast as Tesla, we can extrapolate their current growth to determine what their trailing P/E would be in the next couple of years should their market cap not rise any further. Although their market cap has risen slightly higher, let's use a market cap of $1T to determine if Tesla really deserves to be a trillion dollar company.

--------------------------------

**The trends**

In terms of revenue (LTM), Tesla has grown from $28,176M at the end of Q3 2020 to $46,848M at the end of Q3 2021. A 66% growth YoY.

In terms of operating margin, Tesla has grown from 9.2% in Q3 2020 to 14.6% in Q3 2021.

In terms of net income (LTM), Tesla has grown from $556M after Q3 2020 to $3,468M after Q3 2021. A 524% growth YoY.

---------------------------------

**The future**

Obviously Tesla won't be able to maintain such a high growth rate. The net income figure is heavily distorted by their low profitability in 2020, and their margins may suffer somewhat as they start to ramp up the two new factories that they are building.

That said, these two new factories are each larger than their two current factories combined and are much more efficiently spaced. Additionally, they will be using new technologies like the front and rear underbody gigacasting which should increase margins by quite a bit. On top of that, the percentage of sales that are Model 3's (their cheapest car) will decline as they scale up Model Y at these new factories and reintroduce the refreshed Model S and X, so ASPs should increase.

In terms of future sales, Tesla produced 237,823 cars in Q3. Annualized that gives a current run rate of 950,000 cars. Tesla has announced that they will scale up both their existing factories and start to ramp up both new factories by end of this year. Giga Shanghai ramped up with 300,000 units per year, so assuming Giga Texas and Berlin will ramp up with at least an equal amount, they should be doing 600,000 in 2022, 1,200,000 in 2023 and 1,800,000 in 2024.

----------------------------

**The numbers**

Putting all of the information from the previous section together, I have create a worst and a best case scenario for Tesla's numbers through 2024. In the worst case I assume there are significant unforeseen setbacks that cause them to fall short of those numbers, in the best case I expect them to meet or even slightly exceed them. This brings us to the following projection:

**Sales**

||Worst Case|Best Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2022**|1,400,000|1,700,000|
|**2023**|2,000,000|2,700,000|
|**2024**|2,600,000|3,300,000|

**ASP**

While I mentioned ASPs will likely increase, I have chosen to keep them the same as in Q3 2022 at $50,000 because it's too difficult to predict. This should make sure the final numbers remain conservative.

**Revenue**

||Worst Case|Best Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2022**|$70B|$85B|
|**2023**|$100B|$135B|
|**2024**|$130B|$165B|

**Operating Margin**

Because of the mix of positive and negative effects on margins while ramping up the two factories, I will keep margins the same in 2022 and restart the increasing trend from 2023.

||Worst Case|Best Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2022**|14%|14%|
|**2023**|15%|18%|
|**2024**|16%|20%|

**Net Income**

Multiplying the total revenue by the operating margin gives us the following Net Income:

||Worst Case|Best Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2022**|$9,8B|$11,9B|
|**2023**|$15,0B|$24,3B|
|**2024**|$20,8B|$33,0B|

**P/E**

Dividing our $1T market cap by the projected net income gives us the following trailing P/E values should the stock stay flat around this market cap:

||Worst Case|Best Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2022**|102|84|
|**2023**|67|41|
|**2024**|48|30|

---------------------------

**The conclusion**

Should Tesla trade flat at around a $1T market cap and they continue on their current trajectory, they will be trading at a trailing P/E of between 30 and 48 by the end of 2024. Depending on which scenario plays out (best or worst case) and what you think is a fair valuation for a company growing revenue and margins as quickly as Tesla is, the stock has between 1 and 3 years of growth priced in.

So to conclude, the popular sentiment that ""Tesla has decades of growth priced in"" is false.

**Important side note**

For simplicity sake I have only looked at Tesla's automotive business, as it makes up the vast majority of their revenue and almost all of their Net Income as of this writing. Obviously all of Tesla's future business models, most notably energy and software (FSD and Autobidder), deserve to be taken into account when assigning a valuation to the company. But to avoid ""FSD doesn't exist"" and ""energy is a scam"" kind of comments, I have left these out of the analysis entirely.

**TL;DR: Based on Tesla's current trends, they have between 1 and 2 years of growth priced in when looking purely at their automotive sales.**"

Tesla short sellers lost $8.5 billion in November alone, as the company's shares climbed 46% in the month. That's more than the $6.7 billion Tesla itself lost in the 11 years from when it first reported results in 2008 to the end of last year. 

Dusaniwsky said many of the shorts have closed out their positions — the number of Tesla shares held by short sellers is down 63% so far this year. But he said many are still unwilling to change their minds, despite the losses.

Interesting article about Ethical Investing and how Tesla supposedly rates worse than some tobacco companies,683,0.8,300,2023-06-17,"For those who choose Ethical investments based on ESG ratings, this article is quite enlightening. It points out how some Tobacco companies rate far higher than Tesla because they are more committed to LGBTQ equality and because Tesla doesn't have a diverse boardroom.

It's not really what I imagined the ratings were based on. It's seems too easy for firms to be ""Ethical"" based on ticking some management boxes rather than what they actually do as a business. Surely it should be on the activity of the business and not to do with whether they fly the pride flag (for example)?

"Tesla stands to earn billions by opening U.S. chargers to drivers of Ford, other EVs",552,0.91,175,2024-02-29,"As of Thursday, owners of Ford electric vehicles — the Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning — in North America finally have the ability to power up using Tesla Superchargers.

Ford CEO Jim Farley wrote in a post on LinkedIn that the charging partnership, which involves use of fast-charging adapters, should “improve the EV ownership experience,” for Ford EV drivers, noting that “I’ve tested it myself and its works great.”

Tesla has forged a similar agreement with General Motors, which was announced in June, giving GM customers access to more than 12,000 Tesla fast chargers in the U.S and Canada. GM CEO Mary Barra said at the time that her company expected to save up to $400 million of a planned investment in building out EV charging stations.

The partnerships mark a strategy shift for Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who for years touted the exclusivity of Tesla’s charging network and his company’s ability to build reliable charging locations that would keep consumers from sitting in long lines. Becoming the charging standard has required Tesla to invest heavily in technical and business development.

But Tesla has plenty to gain from working with others.

Sam Fiorani, vice president for global forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, said these efforts should eventually yield huge financial benefits for Tesla, including from environmental credits and fees for charging sessions.

Currently, Tesla operates about one in three charging stations in the U.S. Even if adoption of battery electric vehicles slows domestically, and the fleet of electric vehicles is smaller than what the government and many automakers planned six months ago, “Tesla could still see $6 billion to $12 billion a year,” by 2030 from its expanded charging business, Fiorani said in an email.

While Tesla could lose some customers to other brands by making charging easier, AutoForecast said there are other reasons car buyers flock to Tesla.

“People shopping for a Tesla aren’t typically cross-shopping at Kia, Ford, or Mercedes-Benz dealers because they simply want a Tesla,” Fiorani wrote. “Competition will continue to heat up and Tesla will inevitably lose some sales to rivals, but loyalty to the brand means the vast majority of owners will return to Tesla with little or no comparison shopping.”

Allowing other automakers to tap its charging network also opens up some federal money for Tesla under President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act.

“Tesla is not afraid to use government regulations for income and has been working all possible revenue streams for much of its existence,” Fiorani wrote.

Tesla didn’t respond to a request for further information.

Tesla reports charging revenue with its “Total automotive & services and other segment revenue.” The company hasn’t said whether it may break out revenue from non-Tesla vehicle use of its charging network.

William Navarro Jameson, Tesla’s Strategic Charging Programs lead, wrote in a post on LinkedIn on Thursday that getting to this point with Ford has required a lot of “interoperability testing” along with creating all the necessary hardware and software integrations and working through legal issues.

“There have been so many pieces to this puzzle that have been put in place over the past 18 months,” he wrote.

On social media, Tesla touted the opening up of its charging network in North America and circulated a link to entice more retailers to host Superchargers at their facilities.

Own Tesla Stock? Be Like Elon Musk and Sell,1036,0.83,409,2021-11-09,"From Wall Street Journal: 
“Usu­ally when ex­ec­u­tives an­nounce they are sell­ing stock af­ter a sharp run-up in the price, it is ob­vi­ous to every­one that they think the share price is too high. Mr. Musk seems to have dreamed up a cun­ning plan to try to get round this prob­lem. In­stead of an­nounc­ing he was sell­ing stock, he noted the plan by Sen. Ron Wyden to tax un­re­al­ized cap­i­tal gains, and held a Twit­ter poll on whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla hold­ing. When the Twit­terati duly voted for him to dump shares in the elec­tric-car maker, that con­fused the ques­tion of whether this is an in­sider sig­nal about the share price.

Per­haps Mr. Musk thinks that it’s in­sane that Tesla added $440 bil­lion to its value in the past month alone, a rise—just the rise, not the to­tal—equiv­a­lent to the com­bined mar­ket cap­i­tal­iza­tion of Ford, Gen­eral Mo­tors and Toy­ota.
…
Tesla sits at the in­ter­sec­tion of three strong trends, and a change in any one of them could lead to a rapid fall back in the stock. 

The first are meme stocks. Tesla is the orig­i­nal meme stock, sup­ported by in­di­vid­u­als who’ve done very well by fol­low­ing Mr. Musk, and who don’t take kindly to any­one who dis­agrees. No mat­ter the re­al­ity of sales, com­pe­ti­tion, mar­gins, sub­si­dies or any­thing else, Mr. Musk has at­tracted sup­port­ers who not only buy, but ac­tively pro­mote Tesla shares.

The sec­ond is the will­ing­ness of in­vestors to bet on the far dis­tant fu­ture. Tesla doesn’t make very much money, or in­deed very many cars, at the mo­ment. It is val­ued at $1.3 mil­lion for each of the 900,000 or so cars it is fore­cast to de­liver this year be­cause of the po­ten­tial for growth. The value of the com­pany doesn’t lie in this year or next year’s sales, but on hopes for sales and prof­its far in the fu­ture…

The third sup­port­ive trend is the de­sire for green tech­nol­ogy. It’s great to be an elec­tric-car maker at the mo­ment. Gov­ern­ments are push­ing elec­tric cars and the rest of the in­dus­try is stuck with the wrong sort of fac­to­ries, has the wrong sort of re­search ex­per­tise and hasn’t yet built ve­hi­cle-charg­ing net­works. Tesla is on the right side of gov­ern­ments and in­vestors pledg­ing ac­tion to re­duce car­bon emis­sions. Yet, if the share price change was about Tesla beat­ing the gaso­line-fu­eled com­pe­ti­tion, the shares of tra­di­tional ri­vals should be suf­fer­ing. In­stead, the value of the other car mak­ers has been ris­ing too. It would be great if the stock were do­ing well be­cause in­vestors ra­tio­nally worked out that elec­tric cars will take mar­ket share. In­stead, there has been an un­think­ing rush to buy stock in elec­tric-ve­hi­cle mak­ers, with many of the spec­u­la­tive pure-elec­tric-ve­hi­cle stocks that fell hard from a peak early this year leap­ing again in the past month (and Ford, with a new elec­tric F-150 on the way, soar­ing).”

Tesla earnings are out — here are the numbers,500,0.93,571,2023-01-25,"Electric vehicle maker Tesla reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.

Earnings (adjusted): $1.19 vs $1.13 per share expected, per Refinitiv

Revenue: $24.32 billion vs $24.16 billion expected, per Refinitiv

In the year-ago quarter, Tesla reported revenue of $17.72 billion and adjusted earnings of $2.52 per share.

Earlier this month, Tesla reported vehicle delivery and production numbers for the fourth quarter of 2022 that set a new record for the company, but fell shy of the company’s goals and analysts’ expectations, despite having cut prices on its cars in December to spur customers to take deliveries before the year’s end.

Tesla reported 405,278 vehicle deliveries and production of 439,701 vehicles in the period ending December 31, 2022. Full year deliveries amounted to around 1.31 million, a record for Tesla, after the company started production at its new factories in Austin, Texas, and Brandenburg, Germany.

Last year, Musk said the factories were akin to “money-burning furnaces” in an interview with an owners’ club posted to YouTube in June.

So far in 2023, Tesla has continued to cut prices on its cars around the world, upsetting customers in the US and China who recently bought new Teslas at higher prices, and triggering an instant decline in used Tesla prices in the US as well.

Tesla solicits questions ahead of their earnings calls via a site called Say.com from both retail and institutional investors.

Among other things, investors on that site say they want to know what the recent price cuts will do to Tesla’s automotive gross margins, how much the company expects to grow sales of its cars in 2023, and when Tesla plans to start mass production and deliveries of its long-delayed, sci-fi inspired, pickup truck the Cybertruck.

Throughout the fourth quarter of 2022, shareholders also sought answers from Tesla and Elon Musk about his intentions at the automaker as the price of Tesla shares declined. Tesla’s share price has dropped more than 40% over the past six months. 

Musk is currently splitting his time, attention and resources between Tesla, SpaceX, the defense contractor where he is CEO, and Twitter, the social media business he recently acquired.

The celebrity CEO sold billions of dollars worth of his Tesla holdings last year, including $3.6 billion in the fourth quarter, in part to finance the Twitter deal, which closed in late October 2022. He immediately appointed himself “Chief Twit,” and CEO there.

Since taking over Twitter, he has made sweeping changes to the business and the service, including allowing people who had been permanently suspended from the platform to come back online.

Musk’s moves at Twitter, and his political statements on the social media platform, have correlated with a sharp decline in Musk’s and Tesla’s reputation, especially among liberal- to very liberal-leaning people in the US, according to research by YouGov shared with CNBC.

A decade ago, no major automaker was going to bet on a non-existent electric-vehicle market. Big Auto was happy to sit back and watch Tesla try to create a new segment. But now, almost every carmaker has announced significant electric-vehicle ambitions for the coming decade.

Make no mistake: Without Tesla, this wouldn't be happening. We'd still be asking the circa 2006 question, ""Who killed the electric car?"" if Tesla hadn't reset the EV race in the years before the financial crisis, narrowly avoided bankruptcy, and positioned itself to deliver half a million vehicles in 2021 (and gift investors with a 9,200% return).

Now, the global EV market is poised to grow, especially in China, where auto sales are already millions more annually than in the US, with the potential to top out at twice what the US sees every year, around 16-17 million new cars, trucks, and SUVs. A large percentage of those new sales could be electric, and automakers don't want Tesla to capture them all.

How is Tesla Stock not in a bubble?,907,0.8,920,2020-07-04,"A 200 billion market cap on a company which has never turned a proper profit. Full of debt and in a cut throat industry where margins are slim and competition is fierce. Tesla is being priced like it will take over the world, that 1/2 cars in the world will be a Tesla. Have people forgotten that Ford, GM, Audi and BMW are all making electric cars now? Have people forgotten the self driving technology being developed by Waymo? Have people forgotten the bottomless pit companies like Microsoft have to dominate in AI and self driving?

There is virtually zero moat with what Tesla does, once the germans ramp up full self driving electric cars, where will Tesla go?

As valuations rise, a company has to deliver more and more to justify its price. Eventually it gets to a point where it can't. I want to stress that most great companies were profitable at IPO, Google was profitable, so was Facebook. Companies which don't make money but live on a fairy tale story always end in tears.

For sure there is a future for Tesla, as electric cars become mainstream, but being priced to take over the car industry is a joke and will not happen. There are many people who drive an Audi and will not drive anything else. Software wise I don't see Tesla having any major lead over Big Tech, Microsoft and Audi can very much work together on a self driving electric car.

I know Tesla is a cult and has loyal fans, but you can't compare it to Apple. Apple produce a great product (the iphone) with a massive moat (the apple ecosystem) around it, Tesla doesn't have a moat.

Please explain to me why this valuation is not a bubble? It looks like dot com 2.0 all over again."

Tesla Autopilot has 'critical safety gap' linked to hundreds of collisions: NHTSA,445,0.84,157,2024-04-26,"Federal authorities say a “critical safety gap” in Tesla’s Autopilot system contributed to at least 467 collisions, 13 resulting in fatalities and “many others” resulting in serious injuries.

The findings come from a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration analysis of 956 crashes in which Tesla Autopilot was thought to have been in use. The results of the nearly three-year investigation were published Friday.

Tesla’s Autopilot design has “led to foreseeable misuse and avoidable crashes,” the NHTSA report said. The system did not “sufficiently ensure driver attention and appropriate use.”

NHTSA’s filing pointed to a “weak driver engagement system,” and Autopilot that stays switched on even when a driver isn’t paying adequate attention to the road or the driving task. The driver engagement system includes various prompts, including “nags” or chimes, that tell drivers to pay attention and keep their hands on the wheel, as well as in-cabin cameras that can detect when a driver is not looking at the road. 

The agency also said it was opening a new probe into the effectiveness of a software update Tesla previously issued as part of a recall in December. That update was meant to fix Autopilot defects that NHTSA identified as part of this same investigation.

The voluntary recall via an over-the-air software update covered 2 million Tesla vehicles in the U.S., and was supposed to specifically improve driver monitoring systems in Teslas equipped with Autopilot.

NHTSA suggested in its report Friday that the software update was probably inadequate, since more crashes linked to Autopilot continue to be reported.

In one recent example, a Tesla driver in Snohomish County, Washington, struck and killed a motorcyclist on April 19, according to records obtained by CNBC and NBC News. The driver told police he was using Autopilot at the time of the collision.

The NHTSA findings are the most recent in a series of regulator and watchdog reports that have questioned the safety of Tesla’s Autopilot technology, which the company has promoted as a key differentiator from other car companies.

On its website, Tesla says Autopilot is designed to reduce driver “workload” through advanced cruise control and automatic steering technology.

Tesla has not issued a response to Friday’s NHTSA report and did not respond to a request for comment sent to Tesla’s press inbox, investor relations team and to the company’s vice president of vehicle engineering, Lars Moravy.

Following the release of the NHTSA report, Sens. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., issued a statement calling on federal regulators to require Tesla to restrict its Autopilot feature “to the roads it was designed for.”

On its Owner’s Manual website, Tesla warns drivers not to operate the Autosteer function of Autopilot “in areas where bicyclists or pedestrians may be present,” among a host of other warnings.

“We urge the agency to take all necessary actions to prevent these vehicles from endangering lives,” the senators said.  

Earlier this month, Tesla settled a lawsuit from the family of Walter Huang, an Apple engineer and father of two, who died in a crash when his Tesla Model X with Autopilot features switched on hit a highway barrier. Tesla has sought to seal from public view the terms of the settlement.

In the face of these events, Tesla and CEO Elon Musk signaled this week that they are betting the company’s future on autonomous driving.

“If somebody doesn’t believe Tesla’s going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company,” Musk said on Tesla’s earnings call Tuesday. He added, “We will, and we are.”

Musk has for years promised customers and shareholders that Tesla would be able to turn its existing cars into self-driving vehicles with a software update. However, the company offers only driver assistance systems and has not produced self-driving vehicles to date.

He has also made safety claims about Tesla’s driver assistance systems without allowing third-party review of the company’s data.

For example, in 2021, Elon Musk claimed in a post on social media, “Tesla with Autopilot engaged now approaching 10 times lower chance of accident than average vehicle.”

Philip Koopman, an automotive safety researcher and Carnegie Mellon University associate professor of computer engineering, said he views Tesla’s marketing and claims as “autonowashing.” He also said in response to NHTSA’s report that he hopes Tesla will take the agency’s concerns seriously moving forward.

“People are dying due to misplaced confidence in Tesla Autopilot capabilities. Even simple steps could improve safety,” Koopman said. “Tesla could automatically restrict Autopilot use to intended roads based on map data already in the vehicle. Tesla could improve monitoring so drivers can’t routinely become absorbed in their cellphones while Autopilot is in use.”

"Ride-sharing giants Uber, Lyft jump after Tesla’s ‘toothless taxi’ fails to excite investors",333,0.92,101,2024-10-12,"Tesla’s hyped robotaxi unveiling posed a threat to Uber’s ride-sharing aspirations, but it has turned into a boon for the stock instead.

Uber shares had been falling on the initial investor excitement leading up to Thursday’s event — particularly slumping in early August and mid-September — but surged more than 9% on Friday on renewed enthusiasm that the company is well positioned to advance its autonomous vehicle offerings. The move pushed the stock to a 52-week high and it was leading the S&P 500 higher during the session.

That is a massive turnaround for Uber’s stock, which is now up nearly 22% over the past month and about 38% for the year. Lyft, another major player, is also surging about 10% on Friday. By comparison, Tesla’s shares are plunging during Friday’s trading session and are down more than 11% this year, vastly underperforming both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, which have each gained around 22% so far this year.

The buzz around Tesla’s highly anticipated cybercab has largely dissipated due to a lack of detail on its latest full self-driving technology advancements and the company’s failure to provide insight on its ride-sharing service strategy or economics, among other expectations investors had.

“TSLA’s toothless taxi is a best-case outcome for UBER,” Jefferies analyst John Colantuoni said in a Friday note, noting that the electric car maker provided ambitious targets but little signs of feasibility.

"Tesla stock closes below $200, hits 5-month low as a tough October rolls on",624,0.94,189,2023-10-31,"Despite a larger market gain, Tesla (TSLA) shares fell 4.8% on Monday, going below $200 and reaching its lowest level since late May. The drop was caused by two major factors:  
  
**1.** Tesla's battery supplier, Panasonic, cut vehicle battery output in Japan during the third quarter, decreasing its annual profit prediction by 15%. This was attributable to a worldwide slowdown in EV sales. Panasonic provides battery cells to Tesla's Nevada Gigafactory in the United States. However, the Japanese manufacturing drop had an impact on customers worldwide, not only in North America.  
  
**2.** ON Semiconductor revealed lower-than-expected profit and revenue guidance due to decreasing sales. ON Semiconductor manufactures silicon carbide chips used by Tesla in its EV powertrain and other important components. A decline in demand for these chips is viewed as a possible indicator of slowing EV sales, notably for Tesla.  
  
Tesla investor Gary Black said that the stock's downturn could be attributed to ON Semiconductor's -18% projection failure. This was owing to concerns about the increasing danger to vehicle demand caused by rising interest rates.

"Tesla Stock booms with $32,000 starting price for model 3 after tax credit",466,0.82,376,2023-06-08,"All of the Tesla (TSLA) Model 3 vehicle trims are now eligible for the full tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the Internal Revenue Service verified Tuesday. While it remains unclear how the global EV giant accomplished the feat, the Model 3 now has a starting price of around $32,000. TSLA stock jumped Wednesday.

**Tesla stock advanced 1.6% to 224.83 Wednesday during market trade with Tesla Model 3 vehicles going for as low as $30,330 on the company's website.** 

Tesla is officially saying the Model 3 starts at $32,740 after the $7,500 IRA tax credit. Meanwhile, reports circulated early Wednesday that Tesla has agreed in principle with a plan to set up a manufacturing plant in India. Tesla's website recently stated that the base Model 3 vehicle was eligible for the full $7,500 tax credit under the IRA. The model previously only qualified at the $3,750 level. Tesla has not disclosed how it brought the Model 3 into alignment with IRA requirements for the full tax credit. Meanwhile, the IRS made the official change to its site Tuesday morning. It announced all Model 3 and Model Y vehicles qualify for the $7,500 tax credit.

# Model 3 Tax Credit Doubles

The Biden administration said on March 31 that vehicles eligible for the full $7,500 tax credit must have batteries with specific quantities of components manufactured in North America and critical minerals sourced in the U.S. or from certain countries.

Vehicles that meet only one of the critical minerals or battery components requirements are eligible for a $3,750 tax credit. At the time, the base rear-wheel-drive Model 3, with its battery from China, did not qualify for the full tax credit. 

**Tesla stock shrugged off early losses and climbed 1.7% to 221.31 Tuesday. It turned higher just after the IRS confirmed the Model 3 eligibility. TSLA has gained in the past seven sessions. It has gained 117% since early January lows of 101.81.**

# The Eligibility Switch

Late Monday, Morgan Stanley Adam Jonas wrote the qualification change ""implies that Tesla likely tweaked its supply chain to meet both requirements.

""Tesla has used lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries from China's CATL for the base Model 3. CATL commented Monday that rumors Tesla has ended their relationship are untrue and there is no change in the strategic partnership. 

Jonas told investors Tesla may have switched to manufacturing Model 3 battery packs in the U.S. while still using China-made battery cells. The analysts also floated the idea that, with Shanghai Tesla exporting to Canada, it could be freeing up U.S. battery production for local deliveries. 

Or, Jonas said, it simply could be ""regulatory semantics."" Under guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury, EV manufacturers can average the qualifying critical mineral content used over a limited period of time. Jonas said this language means Tesla could produce enough qualifying Model 3 batteries at its Fremont plant to offset the Model 3 rear-wheel drive trim's China-made battery."

Tesla delivered 310,048 electric vehicles in the first quarter of 2022, below analysts estimates.

Deliveries are the closest approximation to sales numbers reported by Tesla.

After a rough start to 2022, Tesla shares are now up for the year as of Thursday’s close.

Electric vehicle deliveries (total): 310,048

Electric vehicle production (total): 305,407

Over the same period last year, Tesla delivered 184,800 electric vehicles and produced 180,338 cars.

Analysts expected deliveries of 317,000 vehicles for the first three months of 2022, according to estimates compiled by FactSet as of March 31. The estimates ranged from a low of 278,000 vehicle deliveries to a high of 357,000.

Deliveries are the closest approximation to sales numbers reported by Tesla.

The company recently opened a new factory in Brandenburg, Germany, and had a ribbon-cutting ceremony on March 22. Tesla also plans to host a grand opening and “cyber rodeo” event on April 7, at another new vehicle assembly plant it’s building in Austin, Texas.

Tesla moved its headquarters to Austin officially as of Dec. 1, but still operates its first electric car factory in Fremont, California.

Globally, Tesla’s operations during the quarter, which ended March 31, were weighed down by a Covid surge and new health restrictions in China, requiring temporary production halts at its Shanghai plant. In the fourth quarter, Tesla delivered 308,600 EVs, marking a record for the company. 

Tesla, along with the rest of the auto industry, has also been hurt by widespread parts shortages, and inflation. Critical components like semiconductors remain in short supply, and prices have increased for raw materials like nickel and aluminum after Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine in February. In the U.S., Tesla has been leaving customers waiting for months before filling their car orders.

Tesla ($TSLA) shares jumped 3.6% today, extending the company’s record winning streak to 13 sessions in a row. In that time, shares have risen nearly 42%, adding further gains to an already big year for Tesla shareholders.

  
Tesla stock is rising in tandem with the overall market today on cooling inflation data, but the shares have been on the rise for a couple weeks now. The latest big news came late last week when General Motors (GM) announced it was joining forces with Tesla to leverage the electric vehicle maker's Supercharger Network. The companies announced the Tesla Supercharger Network will be open to GM EV drivers starting next year, and by 2025 GM anticipates its EVs will include Tesla’s NACs connector, which will allow for direct access to Tesla Superchargers.

GM’s move comes two weeks after Ford (F) announced a similar partnership with Tesla to enable access for Ford vehicles to Tesla's charging network.  
Several industry analysts recently told Yahoo Finance that Tesla's partnership with Ford would be a positive tailwind for Tesla's revenue moving forward.  
""Recall in our 2022 report that we sized the potential for Tesla opening its network more widely in the next few years (i.e. more than just Ford) at $1-$3 bn of incremental revenue (although Tesla wouldn’t necessarily capture all of this),"" Goldman analyst Mark Delaney wrote in a note following the Ford deal. ""We believe the news is a modest incremental positive for Tesla as it will likely bring in additional profits and help Tesla to sustain the most robust charging network, albeit with some risk of fewer vehicle sales.""Nonetheless it hasn’t all been good news for Tesla during the recent run-up, as the stock brushed aside negative reports about the upcoming and highly anticipated Cybertruck. Per leaked internal documents that German newspaper Handelsblatt reported on, as picked up by Wired, Tesla engineers have had some big concerns about the Cybertruck’s capabilities.  
Preproduction “alpha” versions of the Cybertruck were struggling with basic issues like suspension, body sealing, noise levels, handling, and braking, Wired reports. An automotive engineer Wired spoke with said a company like Tesla has the financial resources to address the issues, but the engineer was still “astounded” that Tesla was struggling with some basic engineering issues with the Cybertruck.  
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has nonetheless promised the company will hold a Cybertruck delivery event later in Q3, with limited production volumes beginning later this year.

This change in tone from Tesla's CEO, who previously claimed the company was ""recession-resilient,"" comes after Tesla missed revenue estimates by a significant margin and Musk acknowledged the difficulty of maintaining a 50% annual delivery growth rate. Some analysts expressed disappointment in Tesla's recent performance.  
  
To meet its annual delivery target of 1.8 million vehicles, Tesla is expected to further reduce prices in the current quarter, even though its gross margin contracted from 25.1% to 17.9% in the past year.

Fifteen analysts lowered their price targets for Tesla, resulting in a median target price of $260.

Tesla on Sunday posted its first-quarter vehicle production and delivery report for 2023.

Here are the key numbers from the electric vehicle maker:

Total deliveries Q1 2023: 422,875

Total production Q1 2023: 440,808

Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales disclosed by Tesla and are not broken out by individual model or region.

The first quarter numbers represent a 36% increase in deliveries compared to the 310,048 reported during the same period a year earlier, and 4% growth in deliveries sequentially compared to the 405,278 they company reported in the last quarter of 2022.

The company reported deliveries of 10,695 of its higher-priced Model S and X vehicles, about 2% of deliveries in the quarter.

Tesla reported deliveries of 412,180 of its lower priced Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover during the quarter.

The company did not include production and delivery numbers for its heavy-duty Semi trucks. 

Tesla said it produced 19,437 Model S and X vehicles, and 421,371 of its Model 3 and Y vehicles for the period ending March 31, 2023.

“We continued to transition towards a more even regional mix of vehicle builds,” the company wrote in a statement Sunday.

Tesla now sells four models which are produced at two vehicle assembly plants in the US, one in Shanghai and another outside of Berlin. In March, CEO Elon Musk announced the company plans to build a new factory in Monterrey, Mexico, a day’s drive from its factory in Austin, Texas.

The company also produces a heavy-duty truck, the Semi, at its battery plant in Sparks, Nevada. The company began deliveries of the Semi in December 2022.

According to a mean of estimates, compiled by FactSet as of Friday, Wall Street was expecting Tesla to report deliveries around 432,000 vehicles for the quarter. Estimates included in the FactSet analysis ranged from 410,000 to 451,000 deliveries expected.

The independent researcher who publishes under the handle TroyTeslike was expecting deliveries of 427,000 and production totaling 445,920 vehicles.

The first quarter of 2023 was marked by repeated price cuts by Tesla including in the U.S., Europe and China.

Tesla’s moves sparked a so-called “price war” in EVs, and posed a challenge to competitors including Ford and General Motors who are trying to gain marketshare in the fully electric vehicle segment domestically.

The analyst raised his price target for the automaker's shares to $1,900 from $1,800 on Monday while maintaining a ""neutral"" rating on the stock. The new 12-month target implies a 15% jump from Friday's close and would place shares at record highs."

Charlie Munger says BYD is so far ahead of Tesla in China it’s almost ridiculous,611,0.87,287,2023-02-15,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/15/charlie-munger-says-byd-is-far-ahead-of-tesla-in-china.html

Charlie Munger said Wednesday that Tesla pales in comparison to BYD in China, calling the Chinese electric vehicle maker his favorite stock ever.

“I have never helped do anything at Berkshire [Hathaway] that was as good as BYD and I only did it once,” the 99-year-old investor said at the Daily Journal’s virtual annual meeting Wednesday. Berkshire initial investment is now “worth about $8 billion or maybe $9 [billion]. That’s a pretty good rate of return,” said Warren Buffett’s longtime investment partner.

BYD has been a lucrative bet for Berkshire , which first bought about 220 million shares in September 2008. The stock has jumped more than 600% in the past 10 years amid the massive growth in electric vehicles. Berkshire has actually been trimming its BYD stake in the past year as the stock has become increasingly pricey.

“At the current price of BYD stock, little BYD is worth more than the entire Mercedes corporation. It’s not a cheap stock, but on the other hand, it’s a very remarkable company,” Munger said.

Munger, Berkshire’s vice chairman and a Daily Journal board member, credited Li Lu, founder of Seattle-based asset manager Himalaya Capital, for introducing him to BYD. Munger also said BYD CEO Wang Chuanfu is unusual, calling him a genius and a workaholic.

Asked if he would prefer Tesla or BYD as an investment, Munger said the answer is easy.

“Tesla last year reduced its prices in China twice. BYD increased its prices. We are direct competitors. BYD is so much ahead of Tesla in China ... it’s almost ridiculous,” Munger said.

BYD recently said it expects record adjusted annual profit for 2022 of 16.3 billion yuan ($2.4 billion), about 1,200% above 2021.

“BYD last year made more than $2 billion after taxes in the auto business in China. It’s incredible what’s happened,” Munger said. “If you count all the manufacturing space they have in China to make cars, it would amount to a big percentage of the Manhattan island, and nobody had ever heard of them a few years ago.”

The longtime investor called Tesla CEO Elon Musk talented — and peculiar. He previously said what Musk achieved in the car business was a “minor miracle.”

“I don’t buy him, and I don’t short him,” Munger said Wednesday."

Musk Sets Sights on Selling 20 Million Teslas by ’27. That Means 70% Annual Growth.,1595,0.92,237,2020-09-28,"Tesla ￼ CEO Elon Musk tweeted Monday morning that his company might sell 20 million cars by 2027 and he sees 30 million electric vehicles sold across the industry.

The numbers are almost too big to contemplate, no matter how investors dissect them, and dissect them they will.

Tesla (ticker: TSLA) is expected to deliver about 141,000 cars in the third quarter of 2020 and 483,000 cars for the full year. That amounts to about 30% growth compared with 2019—an impressive achievement given the global pandemic. Ford Motor ￼ (F) sales, for comparison, are expected to dip about 20% in 2020.

A few numbers were being tweeted. “Seven years for sure to 30 [million plus] new fully electric vehicles per year, six years maybe,” said Musk. “Five years is possible, but unlikely. An extra year makes a giant difference when it comes to exponentials.”

The 20 million stretch goal is more than 40 times higher than this year’s production and works out to an average annual growth rate of roughly 70%. There is precedent. Tesla increased deliveries by about 100% a year on average in the seven years from 2012 to 2019.

But Tesla was starting off a base of fewer than 3,000 cars. What’s more, it invested about $11 billion from 2012 to 2019 to produce more cars. It has become more efficient over time, but raising production to 20 million vehicles could take up to $100 billion. That is a rough estimate and, again, hard to contemplate.

Toyota Motor ￼ (TM) sold about 9 million cars in 2019. It spent roughly $100 billion over the past decade renewing its capacity and retooling plants as new cars were introduced. In the global auto business the numbers are huge.

None of this accounts for the ramp-up in the supply chain that will be required to take EV penetration globally from roughly 2% to 30%, based on Musk’s comments. He spoke to that issue at his company’s Sept. 22 battery technology day. “We’re not getting into the [battery] cell business because we—just for the hell of it,” Musk said. “It’s because it’s the fundamental constraint. It’s the thing that is the limiting factor for rapid growth.""

At the event, Tesla laid out plans to cut battery costs by more than 50%. It also outlined plans to cut the amount of investment required to build new battery capacity by about 75%.

Obviously, 20 million out of 30 million vehicles works out to market share of 67%. Tesla’s share of EV sales in the U.S. was about 55% in 2018 and 2019. Those are the first two years of significant sales of the Model 3, the company’s lower-priced model.

Musk also said he thinks battery improvements will enable the company to profitably sell a $25,000 car. The Model 3 starts at $35,000.

It is worth noting that Tesla achieved 55% share selling cars with an average price of about $75,000. Ford’s average selling price is closer to $30,000 per vehicle.

If Tesla were to reach 20 million sales, it would mean the company is generating, perhaps, $800 billion in sales and $100 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

There is a long way to go to get there. Investors may be inclined to believe Musk. He’s had a good year. Tesla shares are up 387% year to date, as of Friday’s closing price, far better than comparable returns of the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Gains have made Tesla the world’s most valuable auto maker.

The Tesla Bull Case in Brief,922,0.94,420,2020-11-23,"**Disclaimer**

I have no financial position in Tesla at this point in time and no interest in initiating one within the next month.

&#x200B;

# Introduction

There seems to be a strong sentiment among some that Tesla is vastly overvalued, and that the current stock price is completely unrooted in reality. I understand the viewpoint, but don't really share the belief. That's not particularly surprising as I consider myself a Tesla optimist. I decided to present in brief the case for Tesla's valuation as I understand it.

&#x200B;

# Overvalued?

Tesla's current market capitalisation appears to be grossly overvalued, especially when compared to their peers in the automotive sector as [these charts so clearly illustrate](https://preview.redd.it/gdvz8sgmpz061.png?width=1045&format=png&auto=webp&s=45524ed08b3899febc3fa9b67329569e25a906b9).

In fact, the charts actually understate things as Tesla's market cap currently seats at around $464 billion. You could add another Daimler to the US and EU listed companies and they would still have a lower market capitalisation than Tesla.

This really is the case for Tesla being overvalued: it's automotive revenues is many times it's current market capitalisation. [Per MarketWatch, Tesla's trailing PE is 978.44](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/tsla/company-profile?mod=mw_quote_tab), so it's not as if Tesla is especially profitable either.

On a fundamentals basis, Tesla appears to be grossly overvalued.

&#x200B;

# Growth

The above chart doesn't necessarily indicate that Tesla's current market capitalisation is an extremely speculative bubble that could burst soon, but more that Tesla is not valued based on its current financial situation. Tesla is valued as an extreme growth company, and it's growth over the past five years bears this out.

**Revenue**

|Year|Revenue (USD millions)|Growth (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2008|15|\-|
|2009|112|646.67|
|2010|117|4.46|
|2011|204|74.36%|
|2012|413|102.45|
|2013|2,013|387.41|
|2014|3,198|58.87|
|2015|4,046|26.52|
|2016|7,000|73.01|
|2017|11,759|67.99|
|2018|21,461|82.51|
|2019|24,578|14.52|

[Source (Macro Trends)](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/revenue)

&#x200B;

To contextualise this, here's Tesla's trailing CAGR:

|Time span|CAGR (%)|
|:-|:-|
|5 years|50.36%|
|7 years|79.27%|
|10 years|71.45%|

Over the last decade, Tesla has demonstrated formidable growth. There's reason to believe that they can continue to show impressive growth (albeit lowered going forward).

The first two quarters of 2020 were battered by a pandemic (Tesla factories faced lockdowns due to the pandemic), and as a result are somewhat of an exception. There were no lockdowns during Q3.

Looking at Tesla's Q3 results, we see that the formidable growth story continues;

||Q3 2019|Q3 2020|Growth (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Vehicle Deliveries|97,186|139,593|44|
|Automotive Revenues (USD millions)|5,353|7,611|42|
|Storage Deployed (MW)|477|759|59|
|Solar Deployed|43|57|33|
|Energy Revenue|402|579|44|
|Total Revenue (USD millions)|6,303|8,771|39|

&#x200B;

**Going Forward**

Wall Street seems to expect the growth story to continue. Per Market Insider, here are the consensus analyst estimates for the next five years:

|Year|Revenue (USD Millions)|Growth (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2020|30,626|24.61|
|2021|44,937|46.73|
|2022|55,963|24.54|
|2023|79,620|42.27|
|2024|102,526|28.77|

[Source (Markets Insider)](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/tsla-stock)

&#x200B;

I personally think that analyst consensus estimates are significantly underestimating Tesla's growth. In particular their figures for 2020 seem off by $2 billion or more. Analyst estimates for Q3 2020 were off by $495 million, and the estimate of $9,884M for Q4 seems off by around $1,500M (assuming Tesla meets the 180K delivery target) without accounting for the recognition of any deferred revenue. Tesla had $1,258M in deferred revenue at the end of Q3.

This may seem optimistic, but you're welcome to hold me to do this on January 28th 2021.

Despite their (potential) underestimation of Tesla, analysts expect a 5 year CAGR in 2024 of 33%. Tesla is expected to continue to show formidable growth to the end of the decade.

&#x200B;

**Expansion**

Tesla would execute on this formidable growth story through capital expenditure. They will build numerous service centres and gigafactories. The goal is to have giga factories on all 6 economic continents (with some continents having several factories) in order to lower the expenses involved in distributing the cars and to streamline logistics. Currently, Tesla is building two new gigafactories in Berlin and Austin and is currently expanding Giga Shanghai.

An inherent assumption is that the market has the demand to absorb all this extra supply. M[any states have committed to phasing out ICE vehicles](https://preview.redd.it/jpi7br8rpz061.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6524f0cf77a69a52009011eff2160b34c2c1d8e).

[Source (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-out_of_fossil_fuel_vehicles#Countries_and_large_jurisdictions)

&#x200B;

Around 13 states have committed to phasing out ICE vehicles on or before 2030. Over the coming decade, [the EV total addressable market is projected to grow to 27 million by 2030](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/electric-vehicle-market-209371461.html#:~:text=The%20Electric%20Vehicles%20Market%20is,is%20from%202019%20to%202030) (at a CAGR of 21%). This again seems a bit too conservative. [EV sales were down in the first half of 2020 (due to the pandemic), but in July sales grew 77% YoY](https://www.ev-volumes.com/). Some states have also pulled forward their timelines for phasing out fossil fuels since the forecast was initially made.

Tesla would face stiff competition going forward, but the total addressable market would grow fast enough to absorb all of Tesla's growth in supply if they can successfully market their vehicles. The risk here is that Tesla would fail to execute not that the total addressable market isn't large enough.

As an optimist, I'm fine betting on Tesla's ability to execute.

&#x200B;

**Access to Capital**

To fund the massive expansion expected of them, Tesla would need to spend a lot on capital expenditure. Fortunately, access to capital is not a problem for Tesla.

* Tesla's cash on hand at the end of Q3 2020 was $14.5 billion.
   * Per [their 10Q filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data//1318605/000156459020047486/tsla-10q_20200930.htm) this is already sufficient to fund their capex needs up to 2023.
* Free cash flow for the quarter was $1,395M.
* Giving their current market capitalisation ($464 billion) and the mandatory demand from index funds on their inclusion ($60 billion), Tesla has an opportunity to raise $10 - $20 billion in a new capital raise.
   * A $20 billion raise would give them enough cash on hand at the end of 2020 to finance their expansion plans for several years going forward.
* Free cash flow is expected to rise going forward:
   * In Q3 there was a 234% increase QoQ and a 276% increase YoY.
   * Tesla has been seeing increased efficiency of capital expenditures.

&#x200B;

# Margins

Another component of the Tesla bull case is that in addition to hyper growth in revenues, Tesla's profit margins would also rise significantly over the next decade. [This is readily apparent if we look at Tesla's past four quarters](https://preview.redd.it/qygtw9twpz061.png?width=1202&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f6950e6e813a92b1743b89fc56ab8247129fd8d).

[Source (Tesla Investor Relations)](https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/4E7BR9_TSLA_Q3_2020_Update_P0Q85U.pdf?xseo=&response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22TSLA-Q3-2020-Update.pdf%22)

&#x200B;

Automotive gross margins have steadily risen from 22.8% a year ago to 25.4% last quarter and seem set to continue their upwards trajectory. Total gross margins have risen from 18.9% to 23.5%. There are good reasons to expect the rise to continue and maybe even accelerate going forward:

* Manufacturing Efficiencies
* Network Services

&#x200B;

**Manufacturing Efficiencies**

As Tesla continues to ramp up production and innovate, they will be able to drive down the manufacturing cost of their vehicles, benefit even further from economies of scale (both in their production and their supply lines as EV demand heats up globally). Tesla's capital expenditure will become even more efficient; they will be able to squeeze out more manufacturing capacity, from the same amount of capital expenditures.

[Tesla's rise in capex efficiency is apparent when you compare their capex expenditure in 2020 (construction of Giga Berlin, Giga Texas, Fremont Model Y ramp, and expansion of Giga Shanghai) to capex expenditure in 2017 (Fremont Model 3 ramp)](https://preview.redd.it/7r2b1vd0qz061.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=2688cee4dc6abdb063a5ee431dc0193792aedc2b).

[Source (Hypercharts)](https://hypercharts.co/tsla)

&#x200B;

[Despite the lower capex in 2020, Tesla is building a lot more cars](https://preview.redd.it/0xw1tgc3qz061.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=21dd52a5121fdee3102afe62cb7aa9a7b3aee89b).

[Source (Statista)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/715421/tesla-quarterly-vehicle-production/)

&#x200B;

In addition to the aforementioned favourable trends, there are concrete reasons to expect Tesla to perform very well on the capex efficiency front over the next decade. A[t Tesla's battery day, Tesla laid out a roadmap to drastic increases in efficiency](https://preview.redd.it/uujqxx1jqz061.png?width=1942&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea32aa9410a4110984fcce8c32a401b260d63124).

[Source (Tesla Investor Relations)](https://tesla-share.thron.com/content/?id=96ea71cf-8fda-4648-a62c-753af436c3b6&pkey=S1dbei4)

&#x200B;

Tesla is forecasting a **69%!!!** increase in capex efficiency in the coming years.

Furthermore, the cost of batteries is forecast to fall by as much as **56%**. Batteries are a significant component of the total cost, and the reduction in the cost of batteries would further improve Tesla's margins.

Aside from batteries, and capex efficiency, Tesla should also be able to drive down the cost of manufacturing other components of their electric cars due to [Wright's Law](https://ark-invest.com/wrights-law/).

While Tesla would pass on some of these cost savings to the consumer, they wouldn't pass on all of them. This is evidenced by Tesla's improved margins in 2020 despite several price cuts.

&#x200B;

**Network Services**

Tesla's network services are included with their automotive revenues, but represent a novel high margin business that isn't part of the traditional automotive playbook. Using Tesla's fleet as the platform, Tesla can sell software products, subscriptions and other services to their customers. The recurring revenue of subscriptions in particular is a cause for optimism (especially given the potential high margins).

Tesla's existing products:

* Software
   * Full Self Driving: $10,000
   * Enhanced Autopilot: $4,000
      * This isn't currently available was previously an option
   * Acceleration Boosts
      * Model 3: $2,000
      * Model Y: $2,000
* Subscriptions
   * Premium Connectivity: $10/month
   * Full Self Driving: ???
      * Reportedly coming soon
* Miscellaneous
   * Supercharging

Tesla has only a few such products now, but they would likely develop more such products in time. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas referred to this as ""the internet of cars"".

&#x200B;

# Beyond Traditional Automotive Revenues

It's a common statement among Tesla bulls that Tesla is not just an automaker. In my experience sceptics tend to be annoyed by this and (rightly) point out that the supermajority of Tesla's revenue comes from traditional automotive endeavours (selling their cars). While this is true now, it's not necessarily the case 10 years from now, and there's reason to believe that traditional automotive activities may no longer constitute a majority of Tesla's revenue, and may represent an even smaller portion of Tesla's profits.

I'll cover some other businesses of Tesla's that are poised to grow over the next 10 years:

* The aforementioned Network Services
* Energy
* Ridesharing
* Insurance

&#x200B;

**Energy**

Tesla's energy business is poised to benefit substantially from the shift towards renewable power sources. In particular, Tesla's battery storage businesses stands a lot to gain. [Per the Financial Times, total energy storage capacity would grow rapidly over the coming decade to over 700 Gwh by 2030](https://preview.redd.it/wn3yw4g0wz061.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fb25a8c625ab3d725f2895aad4662de4271c6b9).

[Source (Financial Times)](https://www.ft.com/content/7c07e492-41eb-4488-bc34-77b9d806ed5c?shareType=nongift)

&#x200B;

The total addressable market is once again large enough to soak up hyper growth from Tesla over the next decade. Musk himself has stated that he expects Tesla's energy business to be as large as their automotive business long term (a reminder that Tesla's targeted end state is 20 million cars per year).

A refresher on Tesla Energy's available products:

* Solar
   * Tesla solar panels: $1.49/watt (after incentives)
   * Solar Roof
* Battery Storage
   * Power Wall (residential)
   * Power Pack (commercial)
   * Mega Pack (utility scale)

&#x200B;

**Ridesharing**

If Tesla can sufficiently advance their autonomy technology, they may finally be able to launch their autonomous ridesharing network. While Tesla's autonomy technology is currently not yet up to par for this application, their ongoing beta has been rapidly improving with weekly updates. The beta testers have been reporting significant improvements in capability since it was rolled out a month ago.

The bet is that Tesla would be able to reach superhuman driving capability before 2025. Their location agnostic approach would let them scale up operations much more quickly than geofenced competitors (e.g. Waymo).

&#x200B;

**Insurance**

Tesla collates extensive data regarding vehicle usage and the driving patterns of their customers. Combined with their driver assist software, Tesla should be in a privileged position regarding risk assessments for Tesla customers. Using their abundant available data, Tesla may be able to prepare the most compelling insurance package for a sizable fraction of Tesla drivers.

Tesla insurance may also have a synergistic relationship with Tesla's warranty processing and service centres. Tesla insurance customers may be offered discounts on service that wouldn't be available to customers of other insurance providers.

# Expectations

For public accountability purposes, I'll register my Tesla expectations for this year, next year and 2025. I'm not a financial analyst or otherwise particularly financially savvy, so I'll keep it pretty simple. I'll report my 25% - 75% confidence interval on the following metrics:

* Vehicle deliveries
* Total revenue

&#x200B;

||25%|75%|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2020 Deliveries|480,000|520,000|
|2020 Revenue (USD millions)|30,000|36,000|
|2021 Deliveries|800,000|1,200,000|
|2021 Revenue (USD millions)|48,000|78,000|
|2025 Deliveries|3,000,000|5,000,000|
|2025 Revenue (USD millions)|135,000|350,000|

&#x200B;

The growing variation in the interquartile range is a representation of my growing uncertainty about the business.

I have neither a price target for $TSLA nor concrete expectations for its stock price [(I've said in public before that $TSLA might go to $200 before going to $600)](https://preview.redd.it/v86gdkbhyz061.png?width=873&format=png&auto=webp&s=b26af1f3c8bfdf0048c7f9977ba366dcb344c12a).

I simply believe that Tesla will demonstrate hyper growth over the next decade and have a > 10 year investment horizon, so I would be comfortable investing in $TSLA using dollar cost averaging.

&#x200B;

# Closing Remarks

Many are dubious regarding Tesla's ability to deliver on the formidable vision outlined above. There are certainly numerous risks that may challenge Tesla's ability to deliver on hyper growth. However, as mentioned above, the main challenge to the hypergrowth narrative is execution risks. Fundamentally, it's a question of if Tesla can execute on the vision presented above. Giving their formidable track record so far (and the comparatively less than impressive records of the sceptics), I'm willing to bet that they can.

&#x200B;

**Additional Disclosure**

While I have no financial position in $TSLA, I'm sort of an anomalous case. I only became interested in investing a couple of months ago, and I decided to defer any investments I would make until January 2021 to mitigate exposure to political risks. If I did have a portfolio, I'd expect $TSLA would feature in it (probably at around a 10% initial weighting)."

"Tesla cutting around 2,700 jobs in Austin as part of broad restructuring",432,0.95,119,2024-04-23,"Tesla is eliminating around 12% of its workforce at a factory in Austin, Texas, as part of a broader restructuring the company announced last week.

According to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act letter on Tuesday, the layoffs affect 2,688 employees at the facility in Travis County. In 2021, Tesla CEO Elon Musk moved the company’s corporate headquarters to Austin from Palo Alto, California.

Musk said in an internal memo last week that Tesla was cutting more than 10% of its global headcount as the electric vehicle maker reckons with flagging sales and increased competition. He did not say which departments or locations would be most affected.

“As we prepare the company for our next phase of growth, it is extremely important to look at every aspect of the company for cost reductions and increasing productivity,” he wrote. A subsequent WARN notice filed in New York indicated that 285 positions were being eliminated at a factory in Buffalo.

Tesla employed 140,473 people as of December, according to filings.

Tesla officially opened its Texas EV and battery factory in April 2022, with a “cyber rodeo” party. The company now manufactures some of its Model Y crossover utility vehicles in Austin, and has started to build its Cybertruck there.

Musk later called the Austin factory, and another assembly plant in Germany, “gigantic money furnaces,” in an interview with Tesla Owners Silicon Valley, a fan club that promotes Tesla vehicles.

According to filings with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation, Tesla was planning to spend upward of $770 million last year on the construction of expanded facilities in Austin, including for battery cell testing and manufacturing, cathode and drive unit manufacturing, plus a die shop, among other things.

Tuesday’s WARN filing said, “none of the employees are represented by a union and none of the employees have bumping rights,” or the right of more senior workers to replace those with less seniority.

Should Musk at least give guarantees he won't let xAI compete with Tesla?,169,0.72,194,2024-06-10,"Regarding Musk's $56 billion pay package, should Tesla shareholders BEFORE approving FIRST demand from Musk to give written, legally-binding guarantees on how precisely he wants to develop AI at Tesla and explain how his other company xAI won't compete with Tesla? 

I think it's problematic Musk diverted nVidia chips paid with Tesla money to his other company xAI and will allow xAI to use those chips till at least end of 2024. That will benifit xAI but not necessarily Tesla.  

I honestly think retail investors in Tesla should vote NO on the pay package and first get more legal guarantees from Musk regarding Tesla's AI future. Stock dilution is another problem."
Tesla to recall over 1.1 million cars in China for software updates.,555,0.82,218,2023-05-12,"BEIJING, May 12 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc will recall a total of 1,104,622 vehicles, both imported and China-made ones, China's market regulator said on Friday.

So... What's the deal with Tesla? What is it that makes people so confident in it?,446,0.84,816,2021-11-13,"So I've been sitting on the sidelines for quite a while on Tesla while everyone else around me go all in. My gut feeling tells me that if everyone flocks to one thing, there must be something fishy about it all.

I can't lie, I've been tempted time and time again to jump in, seeing my friends make 10% in a single day and what not. I guess I am only human. However, after reading the works of Buffet, Howard Marks, Munger, and those gentlemen (which i consider my teachers), Tesla just seems to go against their philosophy; especially when it comes to the margin of safety principle.

Now Tesla is a special case, if we look at Tesla as a company, their debt is consistently decreasing, equity and profits are growing like crazy, all of that is good. It's just the valuation. Currently at a P/E of \~300 for instance, it means they have A LOT to back up for in the near future and the public obviously has high hopes in them. But my question is, what exactly is this hope? I am not very informed about Tesla, neither am I an engineer, which is why I wanna hear some of your opinions about them.

\- What is their specific moat when it comes to the electric cars? How will this moat be protected by other automobile dealers? (i.e the Germans, Ford, the Chinese, etc...) Is it just their brand or do they have superior technology that will actually be hard to replicate/improve by other companies in the coming 10 years?

\- What other ventures are they going into besides cars? Is it A.I? What constitutes as A.I? If it is a personal robot who does the dishes for you and cleans your house, in what way will they have superior engineers compared to the other giants such as Alphabet and Microsoft? And why will they perform better than them?

Basically, what is it that they do that makes people so confident in them, and what is it that accounts for this valuation?"
What justifies Tesla's high P/E ratio amid all of the headwinds? (Unbiased answers please),114,0.8,182,2024-07-25,"Tesla's fundamentals are weak. Revenue and income has been declining YoY for two consequtive quarters now. Vehicle deliveries declining. Their market is getting eaten away by competitors and they have no strategy to combat that. Reliability (a proxy for product quality) is mid-tier. Their R&D projects are missing schedules for a while, and has no substance. 

Even though there aren't much positive indicators around the stock for a while now, why do they have such a high P/E ratio (60 as of this post)? What is the justification?

A typical response may be ""because Elon is a good liar"" or some anti-Elon emotional take, but I refuse to believe that such a superficial factor can support such a high P/E ratio. The average P/E ratio of other top car manufacturers is around 18. I can believe it if the Elon factor pushes it up to around 30, but 60 is just ridiculous. 

What are the investors and traders looking at? Am I missing something? Or is this a purely speculative bubble and are we in for a royal shitstorm when it pops?"

***This is from*** ***CNBC Pro.....***

***Key Takeaway:***

*\*JPMorgan cuts Tesla's price target to $130, predicting a 30% drop due to profit concerns and high valuation at 56 times 2024 consensus earnings.*

*\*Despite a 20% increase in vehicle volume, Tesla's Q4 automotive revenue grew only by 1%, indicating price cuts aren't boosting revenue significantly.*

*\*Tesla's operating profit forecast for this year is now $11.4 billion, down from an October estimate of $28.5 billion, yet share prices remain similar.*

***JPMorgan Lowers Price Target for Tesla:***

*JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman cuts the stock price target for Tesla by about 4% to $130, implying a 30% downside from Thursday’s close of $182.63. The reduction follows softer than expected earnings and a warning from Tesla that vehicle volume growth ""may be notably lower"" this year. Despite these warnings, Tesla's stock closed down only 12%, suggesting further downside potential according to Brinkman.*

***Falling Profits and Valuation Concerns:***

*Tesla's strategy of slashing vehicle prices has not translated into higher revenue, with actual automotive revenue growing by only 1% despite a 20% increase in vehicle volume in the fourth quarter. Analysts have substantially lowered profit expectations for Tesla since October 2022, with operating profit forecasted at $11.4 billion compared to the previous estimate of $28.5 billion for 2024.*

*Brinkman rates Tesla as underweight due to above-average execution risk and valuation concerns that seem to be pricing in significant upside related to expansion into mass-market segments beyond their volume forecasts for the Model 3.*

***STREET VIEWS***

*Ryan Brinkman, JPMorgan Analyst (Bearish on Tesla):*

*""Tesla profit expectations have fallen, but even after Thursday's sell-off, the stock to us seems in comparison to have hardly noticed, suggesting plenty of further downside potential."" ""Tesla did not trade profits for sales as measured in revenue — it has traded profits for sales as measured in unit volume."" ""Although both technology and execution risk seem substantially less than was once feared, expansion into higher volume segments with lower price points seems fraught with greater risk relative to demand, execution, and competition.""*

That's according to Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities senior tech analyst, who said in a note to clients on Sunday that demand from China could help Tesla reach or possibly exceed it's once implausible goal of 500,000 deliveries by the end of 2020. Ives sees Tesla surging 56% from current levels to $1,000 a share in his bull case scenario. 

""We believe the company is tracking to another strong month of December in China which could be the tipping point to get Musk & Co. to hit/exceed its 500k annual delivery target, an achievement not even on the map for the Street going back to the late spring/summer timeframe,"" Ives said.

""The China growth story is worth at least $100 per share in a bull case to Tesla as this EV penetration is set to ramp significantly over the next 12 to 18 months, along with major battery innovations coming out of Giga 3 and elsewhere throughout the China EV supply chain,"" the analyst added.

"Tesla has built 3 million vehicles, a third of those in China, Elon Musk says",550,0.9,338,2022-08-15,"Tesla Inc. has produced more than 3 million vehicles, and a third of them have been built in China, according to Elon Musk. On Sunday, the Tesla chief executive congratulated the company’s Shanghai “gigafactory” in a tweet: “Congrats Giga Shanghai on making millionth car! Total Teslas made now over 3M.”

The milestone came just a few weeks after Musk said Tesla’s factory in Fremont, Calif., produced its 2 millionth vehicle. Tesla also has new factories in Austin, Texas, and Berlin, which Musk in June referred to as “money furnaces.” The Shanghai factory opened in 2018, but it has been plagued by temporary shutdowns due to COVID-19 restrictions and parts shortages. In July, Tesla said it delivered nearly 255,000 vehicles in the second quarter, down about 18% from the previous quarter. Still, the electric-auto maker beat Wall Street’s expectations in its second-quarter earnings, defying projections that Shanghai shutdowns would hurt its bottom line. 

When earnings were released, Musk said the company had been in “supply-chain hell for several years,” but barring a surprise, “we have the potential for a record-breaking second half of the year.” 

In that report, Tesla said the Shanghai factory achieved “the highest vehicle production month in our history” in June. Tesla shares TSLA, +4.68% have rallied 25% over the past month, as it gets set for a 3-for-1 stock split Aug. 24, but they are still down about 15% year to date, compared to the S&P 500’s SPX, +1.73% 10% decline this year."

> Chinese carmaker BYD is gaining momentum in the increasingly competitive global EV race, while the dominance of longtime leader Tesla wanes.

> The Warren-Buffett backed carmaker on Monday reported a 13% year-over-year increase in “new-energy” vehicle sales, which includes both electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. In total, the company sold 626,263 vehicles in the first quarter, of which about 300,114 were pure EVs.

> BYD’s strong first quarter performance contrasts with plummeting expectations for Elon Musk-owned EV maker Tesla, whose stock has dropped nearly 30% year-to-date.

> Several analysts have revised down their projections for the company’s first quarter vehicle deliveries (an approximate gauge for sales), after reports of a cutback in production at Tesla’s factory in Shanghai.

> Wedbush Securities cut their estimate to 425,968 from about 475,000. If Wedbush’s prediction is accurate Tesla’s vehicle deliveries will have grown less than 1% year over year, but would still be higher than BYD’s pure EV sales during the same period.

Tesla Starts Offering 84-Month Loans as Interest Rates Rise,299,0.9,293,2023-07-23,"Tesla Inc. has started offering consumers 84-month auto loans after Elon Musk said the carmaker would “have to do something” about rising interest rates. The company now includes seven-year loans as an option on its US order pages, after previously offering loans as long as 72 months. While extending loan terms can lower car buyers’ monthly payments, consumers tend to pay more in interest and face greater risk of owing more than their vehicle is worth.

Tesla’s chief executive officer has been a frequent critic of the Federal Reserve. Musk tweeted in November that the central bank’s rate increases were “massively amplifying the probability of a severe recession.” His predictions of impending deflation haven’t yet panned out.“When interest rates rise dramatically, we actually have to reduce the price of the car, because the interest payments increase the price of the car,” Musk said during Tesla’s July 19 earnings call. “So we have to do something about that.”

While 84-month auto loans have been gaining in popularity, the trend slowed early this year, according to credit-reporting company Experian. Roughly 34% of new vehicles loans in the first quarter were longer than six years, down from about 38% a year ago. Tesla delivered a record 466,140 vehicles during the three months that ended in June but has sold fewer cars than it’s produced each of the last five quarters. The shares plunged after Musk said on this week’s call that the company will have to keep lowering prices if interest rates continue to rise.

Tesla earnings are out – here are the numbers,435,0.93,586,2022-01-26,"Tesla reported fourth-quarter earnings after the bell. Here are the results.

Earnings (adjusted): $2.54 vs $2.36 per share expected, per Refinitiv

Revenue: $17.72 billion vs $16.57 billion expected, per Refinitiv

Revenue rose 65% year over year in the quarter, while net income, at $2.32 billion, was up some 760%, according to a statement.

Tesla reported a 27.4% gross margin, compared with 26.6% in the previous quarter.

“Our own factories have been running below capacity for several quarters as supply chain became the main limiting factor, which is likely to continue through 2022,” the company said.

The report comes in the midst of the most important tech earnings season in years. The Nasdaq has suffered its worst January since 2008 as many investors have begun to sour on the promise of high-growth tech stocks.

In 2021, Tesla delivered 936,172 vehicles, an 87% increase versus 2020 when it reported its first annual profit on deliveries of 499,647. Its 2021 deliveries included 308,600 electric vehicles in the fourth quarter. (Deliveries are the closest approximation to sales reported by Tesla.)

CEO Elon Musk and other execs are expected to give a progress update on the company’s long-delayed heavy duty Semi truck, experimental Cybertruck pickup, and plans for driverless vehicle systems and a $25,000 compact car.

With factories being built in Austin, Texas, and Brandenburg, Germany, shareholders also want to know when high-volume vehicle production and deliveries are expected to start at each plant.

Tesla’s guidance may be tempered by supply chain issues, if Musk’s tweets are any indication. On November 29, 2021, he wrote on Twitter, “Oh man, this year has been such a supply chain nightmare & it’s not over! I will provide an updated product roadmap on next earnings call.”

"Tesla recalls 362,758 vehicles, says full self-driving beta software may cause crashes",557,0.84,210,2023-02-16,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/16/tesla-recalls-362758-vehicles-says-full-self-driving-beta-software-may-cause-crashes.html

Tesla said Thursday it’s recalling “certain 2016-2023 Model S, Model X, 2017-2023 Model 3, and 2020-2023 Model Y vehicles equipped with Full Self-Driving Beta (FSD Beta) software or pending installation.” The recall includes 362,758 vehicles.

The FSD Beta system may cause crashes by allowing the affected vehicles to: “act unsafe around intersections, such as traveling straight through an intersection while in a turn-only lane, entering a stop sign-controlled intersection without coming to a complete stop, or proceeding into an intersection during a steady yellow traffic signal without due caution,” according to the notice on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

The FSD Beta system may also have trouble responding appropriately “to changes in posted speed limits,” the notice said.

The group of affected vehicles included the following years and models: 2016-2023 Model S and Model X, 2017-2023 Model 3, and 2020-2023 Model Y vehicles equipped with or pending installation of FSD Beta.

Tesla lets thousands of drivers try new and unfinished driver assistance features on public roads in the U.S. through FSD Beta. The technology does not make Tesla electric cars autonomous, nor safe to drive without a human at the wheel ready to brake or steer at any second — despite the brand name.

Only Tesla owners who have the company’s premium FSD driver assistance system installed in their cars can join the FSD Beta program. That option now costs $15,000 up front or $199 per month in the U.S. today. Owners must obtain a high driver-safety score, as determined by Tesla software that monitors their driving habits, and maintain it to get FSD Beta access.

FSD Beta can best be summarized as a host of new features that are not yet fully debugged. The main attraction is “autosteer on city streets,” which lets a Tesla navigate around complex urban environments automatically, if imperfectly."
Tesla internal data shows company has slashed at least 14% of workforce this year ,243,0.93,121,2024-06-22,"Tesla’s hefty downsizing since 2023 has reduced its global head count to just over 121,000 people, including temporary workers, internal records suggest, indicating that the automaker has slashed more than 14% of its workforce so far this year.

The latest figure is not from precise payroll data, but from the number of people who are on Tesla’s “everybody” email distribution list as of June 17, a tally viewed by CNBC.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk sent an email to “everybody” that day. He told employees, “Over the next few weeks, Tesla will be doing a comprehensive review to provide stock options grants for exceptional performance.” He added that options grants will also be awarded to “anyone who does something outstanding for the company.” Tesla’s plan to reinstitute options grants, after previously pausing performance-based equity awards, was reported first by Reuters.

Tesla’s layoffs announcement landed in April, when Musk sent out a companywide email telling employees that the automaker would be cutting more than 10% of its staff. Layoffs at that point were already underway.

Bloomberg reported that Musk was aiming for a 20% staff cut. Musk indicated that the number could be even bigger. On the company’s first-quarter earnings call later in April, he said Tesla had reached an inefficiency level of 25% to 30% after “a long period of prosperity” that began in 2019.

“We’ve made some corrections along the way,” Musk said on the call. “But it is time to reorganize the company for the next phase of growth.”

In a filing for the fourth quarter, Tesla said its employee head count worldwide at the end of December was 140,473, a number that represents salaried and hourly staffers. The “everybody” email list includes temporary workers. At around 121,000, that suggests Tesla has reduced overall headcount by at least 14% since the end of 2023.

Tesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

In at least one instance, Musk’s head-count reductions went too far. Tesla dismantled its Supercharging team, which consisted of hundreds of employees, including its leader, Rebecca Tinucci. The company later hired some of those people back, according to posts on LinkedIn.

The broader cuts coincide with a slippage in sales at Tesla as the company reckons with an aging lineup of electric vehicles and increased competition in China as well as brand deterioration that a recent survey attributed partly to Musk’s “antics” and “political rants.” For the first quarter, Tesla reported a 9% drop in annual revenue, the biggest decline since 2012.

Across the auto industry, EV sales growth slowed this year after two years of rapid expansion. The slide was particularly acute for Tesla, whose Model Y was the top-selling car worldwide in 2023.

A Tesla employee, who asked not to be named in order to discuss sensitive internal issues, told CNBC that some factory workers are fearful more layoffs could follow in July, depending on second-quarter results.

A production and deliveries report for the second quarter is expected from Tesla during the first week of July.

Musk has promised investors the company will soon publish a new “Master Plan,” which would be his fourth, and that Tesla will reveal its design for a “dedicated robotaxi” on Aug. 8.

Tesla shares were little changed on Friday at $181.71. The stock is down 27% this year, while the Nasdaq is up 18%.

* **Up to half of the Elon Musk-run EV maker's profitability comes from China sales, the bank said.**
* **Tesla and Chinese tech stocks have both fallen sharply this year as recession fears intensify**

**Tesla rakes in so much of its profits from Chinese sales that it will behave like a tech stock listed on Hong Kong's Hang Seng or the Shanghai Composite index until at least 2030**, according to Morgan Stanley.

The electric carmaker is likely to find itself closely tethered to the price movements of China's tech stocks because up to half of its profits come from that country, its analysts said in a Monday research note.

""**We estimate Tesla generates as much as one-half of its profitability from the Chinese market, arguably making the stock a derivative of a Chinese tech stock,**"" the team led by equity analyst Adam Jonas said.

Tesla's reliance on sales to China makes it vulnerable to a rise in geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington, Morgan Stanley said.

Recently, Musk was praised by Chinese government officials for suggesting that Taiwan — a flashpoint in tensions with the US — should become a special administrative zone like Hong Kong.

Tesla will likely be reliant on its sales in China until at least 2030, the Morgan Stanley team said. That leaves it exposed, if the hostilities between the US and China intensify.

""The broader arc of Sino-US economic relations and the evolving geopolitical situation will continue to add volatility to Tesla shares,"" the bank said.

""Our forecasts through 2030 become gradually less China-dependent, but this takes time.""

Why do you guys even bother trading when you can just buy the S&P 500?,2168,0.89,1267,2024-10-17,"I’m genuinely curious. I’m not trying to dog on any of yall. I’m sure some of you have made a lot of money on individual stocks.

But like… I struggle to understand why you guys even bother. I just don’t see a point in investing in single company stocks.

They’re too volatile, companies change, etc. for instance Cisco used to practically be a monopoly. Now I’m not even sure it’ll reach the ATH from 20 years ago… ever. 

Also all of the time invested. Time is money… you really gotta research a lot before even considering buying stocks. 

So why not just go S&P 500, bonds, 401k, etc. it’s going great for me (130k net worth at 25.) 

Just curious, thanks. "
Novo Nordisk market cap surpasses Tesla on new obesity pill trial data,354,0.97,125,2024-03-08,"Wegovy obesity drug maker Novo Nordisk surpassed Tesla in market value, after fresh early trial data showed positive results for its new experimental weight loss pill.

Shares of the Danish company hit a record high on Thursday, rallying by as much as 8%, after telling investors that a Phase I trial of the company’s amycretin pill showed 13.1% weight loss in participants after 12 weeks.

Novo Nordisk is now the 12th most valuable company in the world, with a market cap of $604 billion — ahead of Tesla’s $569 billion, according to FactSet data.

Shares were trading slightly lower on Friday, down 0.5%, by 10:00 a.m. London time.

The uptick of Thursday extends a months-long rally for Novo Nordisk, as excitement grows around weight loss drugs and their potential wider applications. The company is now the most valuable in Europe, with a valuation larger than Denmark’s total gross domestic product last year.

The early amycretin data marks a fresh milestone for Novo Nordisk, potentially offering a more effective and less intrusive alternative to its already widely successful injection-based Wegovy and Ozempic drugs. Wegovy showed weight loss of 6% in a 12-week trial, while Ozempic is a diabetes treatment.

A Phase II trial of amycretin will begin in the second half of this year, with results expected in early 2026, the company said Thursday. The treatment will then be subject to Phase III and Phase IV trials — a process which could take years.

Still Novo’s head of development Martin Holst Lange said Friday that he anticipated that the pill could be available to consumers “within this decade.”

“I never commit to timelines but I would be very comfortable to say at the very least within this decade,” Lange he said, according to Reuters.

The company also said that it expects amycretin, and its other new experimental obesity drug CagriSema, to have similar cardiac benefits to Wegovy.

Earlier on Thursday, Novo Nordisk said that it was expanding its focus to include cardiovascular disease treatments, as it seeks to position its offering as more than a “vanity” drug.

A large late-stage study on Tuesday showed that Ozempic delayed progression of chronic kidney disease in diabetes patients, reducing the risk of death from that and major cardiac events by 24%.

It follows previous studies demonstrating that Wegovy lowered the risk of serious cardiovascular complications in people with obesity and heart disease.

Investors have been closely watching the progression of obesity treatments and the underlying appetite-suppressing GLP-1 drug class, for an indication of their wider market implications.

Ahead of the latest developments, Barclays forecast in 2023 that the weight loss drug industry could be worth as much as $200 billion by the end of the decade, with its applications likely to disrupt sectors well beyond health care.

The Tesla Cybertruck Is Here.

Morgan Stanley is cutting its position in Tesla stock. Here's why,165,0.83,112,2024-08-26,"It seems that Morgan Stanley has finally seen the writing on the wall.

Morgan Stanley said it is slashing its position in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, citing a “continued slowdown in the auto industry, intense competition among electric vehicles (EVs) and reduced consumer preferences” for EVs.

TSLA has been a part of Morgan Stanley’s model portfolio since March 2021, with the position increased in both September and December 2022. However, the stock was reduced in November 2023.

Since the last stake boost in December 2022, Tesla has delivered a 15% return, trailing the Russell 1000 Growth Index (RLG) by 46%, Morgan Stanley strategists highlighted.

“While we continue to hold a position in TSLA, due to the optionality of its various nonauto assets, we see an attractive opportunity to reallocate some of the position to other, less-volatile stocks that are not as economically sensitive and may have less pricing pressure,” they wrote.

Despite Tesla’s status as the leading electric vehicle company in the U.S., with potential growth avenues in robotics, AI, and energy storage, the strategists have decided to reduce the position to make room for stocks with higher earnings viability such as Spotify (NYSE:SPOT).

Earlier this week, the European Union announced that it would reduce planned tariffs on Tesla vehicles imported from China, lowering them from 20.8% to 9%. The EU is also cutting planned import duties for several other electric vehicle manufacturers.

These new tariffs will be in addition to the existing 10% duties already imposed by the EU on battery electric vehicle imports.

In June, the EU indicated it would impose higher tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports, arguing that these vehicles ""heavily benefit from unfair subsidies"" and present a ""threat of economic injury"" to European EV producers."
Tesla's shady Q1 results (real GAAP EPS at $0.12 or 65% below reported EPS),296,0.79,123,2024-04-26,"**Deferred FSD Revenue Recognition May Have Boosted Q1 Profits Significantly**

Tesla’s Q1 revenues missed by 2.3% and non-GAAP EPS was 8.2% below estimates (see Figure 3). This was not as bad as had been feared and the stock ripped upwards by 13.3% in after-hours trading.

Despite continued price cuts, a one-month shutdown of production at their German factory, and 20% lower deliveries than in Q4 2023, Tesla somehow managed to eke out roughly flat Automotive gross margins of 18.5% in Q1 versus 18.9% in Q4 2023. Imagine having flat gross margins despite 20% lower volumes and roughly 5% lower prices.

This sounded alarm bells in my head and it turns out to be the biggest takeaway from the Q1 results: deferred FSD revenue recognition must have been huge. While Tesla noted in their Shareholder Deck that they recognized deferred FSD revenues in Q1, they did not provide a number and none of the analysts on the earnings call asked about it.

A few facts about Tesla’s FSD deferred revenue recognition:

* Deferred FSD revenue recognition is only disclosed in Tesla’s 10-Qs and they are booked within Automotive Revenues. This means we won’t know the amount booked in Q1 until next week when the 10-Q is released.
* Contribution to profits is substantial as these revenues have nearly 100% profit margins. They also boost average revenue/unit calculations unless stripped out.
* Only the full-year numbers are audited.
* Deferred revenues are a non-cash item so do not impact cash flows.
* Tesla clearly uses these deferred revenues to prop up profits during weak quarters. Figure 1 shows that the highest bookings (highlighted in red) were made during the weakest quarters of the past 3 years.

"Tesla cuts prices in U.S., Germany in pivot to drive sales",364,0.95,325,2023-01-13,"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-cuts-prices-electric-vehicles-us-market-2023-01-13/

Tesla has cut prices on its top-selling electric vehicles in the United States and Germany, the automaker's website showed, extending a new strategy of aggressive discounting after missing Wall Street estimates for fourth quarter deliveries.

The U.S. price cuts, announced late Thursday in U.S. time on the Model 3 and Model Y, ranged between 6% and 20% compared with the prices that held before the discount, according to a Reuters calculation.

That is before accounting for a $7,500 federal tax credit that took effect for many electric vehicle models at the start of January.

In Germany, Tesla cut prices on the Model 3 sedan and the Model Y crossover - its global top-seller - by between about 1% and amost 17% depending on the configuration.

For a U.S. buyer of the long-range Model Y, the new Tesla price combined with the U.S. subsidy that took effect this month amounts to a discount of 31%.

Taken together with price cuts announced last week in China and other Asian markets, the move marked a reversal in Tesla's largest markets from the strategy it had pursued through much of 2022 when demand was strong and average sale prices for its electric vehicles had been trending higher.

The shift is the first major move by Tesla since appointing its lead executive for China and Asia, Tom Zhu, to oversee global output and sales after falling short of its 2022 delivery target.

Tesla cut prices in China and other Asian markets last week. Along with a previous price cuts announced in October and recent incentives, the China price for a Model 3 or Model Y was down 13% to 24% from September after the recent move, Reuters calculations showed.

Tesla has also cut prices in South Korea, Japan, Australia and Singapore.

Analysts had said the China price cuts would boost demand and deepen the pressure for its rivals there, including BYD to follow suit in what could become a price war in the largest single market for electric vehicles.

Tesla's main market is the United States, and its second largest market is China.

Tesla missed Wall Street estimates for fourth quarter deliveries.

Last month, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said ""radical interest rate changes"" had changed the industry-wide outlook and that Tesla could lower pricing to sustain volume growth, which would result in lower profit."

Nvidia is obviously the king of AI right now and probably for the foreseeable future. Their forward PE is 40 and not too high for a growth stock. I don't see any real competitors, maybe AMD, but that's a stretch.

Microsoft is in an interesting spot. They acquired OpenAI and incorporated that in Bing. I'm not sure what direction they're trying to go with that.

"Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review 12/24/22",275,0.77,342,2022-12-24,"As always, below represents my opinions and should not be construed as financial advise. Always do you own due dilligence. I welcome your feedback of my opinions.

· **Company Description**

o ELI5 the company’s business model

§ Tesla primarily designs, develops and manufactures fully electronic vehicles and has a smaller solar generation and battery storage business. They are currently investing into self-driving vehicles and humanoid robots.

· **Company Soundness**

o How does the company collect revenue? Does the company have a good or services that is purchased frequently or a regular interval?

§ Tesla sells their products Direct to consumer. Their cars and solar options are purchased directly on their website. Most of the products they sell are durable goods. That is to say they are high ticket items that are often purchased once and without a frequent and recurring interval. Having said that, since Tesla is vertically integrated, they also have the potential to grow a larger service revenue stream for their products.

o Do they operate with significant leverage?

§ Very little. Tesla uses a meager $0.14 of debt for every $1 of equity on their balance sheet. This compares with 3.08 to 1 at Ford 1.76 to 1 at GM. Consequently, they have an extremely high 56x interest coverage ratio.

o Is their balance sheet will suited for a downturn and why?

§ Yes, between the low debt and significant cash cushion they are well cushioned. This is evidenced by $19.5 billion in cash, $2.41 billion in unused credit lines. Additionally, Tesla is cash flow positive with the widest cash flow margins in the industry. Tesla expects Capex to be 6-8 billion over next two years. Management reported on their September 22 10-Q that they believe they have sufficient capital to fund their growth plans.

§ They do have $983 million of debt due in the next 12 months which is easily covered from their cash stash or through a refinance and extension of maturity.

· **Can it be Replicated?**

o Is there evidence that the company has defended its market position in the past?

§ None. Tesla is a new company and electric vehicles within transportation is a new industry. Having said that, history of the auto industry suggests high barriers. You have a business with large, fixed costs, a cyclical product and need some level of scale to allow customers to believe they can get it serviced.

§ Additionally, like capitalism often does, high returns attract new capital and bring about lower returns. The flight of capital has been seen; the question is will new players be able to make enduring franchises in a historically tough market?

o Is there evidence that market power is growing and that this will lead to strong financials?

§ Yes. Tesla now has enough scale to rival legacy auto manufacturers. They crush Ford and GM in virtually every financial metric. (TSLA, F, GM is the order of the following)

§ Gross Margin: 26.6%, 11.4%,13.6%

§ ROA: 17%, 3.5%, 3.8%

§ FCF margin: 11.9%, 1.7%, 0.8%

o What is the competitive advantage?

§ In my view, they have two advantages at this point: low-cost provider and Intangible assets

§ Low-Cost Provider:

· Relative to legacy players, Tesla has a lower cost operating model. For example, by selling 100% of their cars DTC they can sell them at retail prices to consumer whereas legacy auto sells their cars to dealers at wholesale prices. During a recessionary period, this will serve to benefit Tesla. As customers defer purchases of cars, prices will typically fold (this has started to occur with the most recent series of inflation reports) When you have 22% gross margins and 12% FCF margins, you can drop prices far lower and be profitable than when your competitors are at \~12% gross margins and \~1% free cash flow margins.

· It appears that this advantage is not done being flexed. Even with a lower overall volume of cars being sold combined with a significantly higher growth rate, Tesla’s revenue/employee continues to soar. Currently it is about the same as Ford and GM. I would expect in future years with additional growth, Tesla will surpass them.

§ Intangibles

· As a brand, Tesla is the undisputed leader in EVs. Having said that, Elon’s moves into twitter and more importantly politics of late have caused some people to put their nose up at Tesla. I personally feel this will be a passing thing, particularly as Elon has announced his intent to step down as CEO of twitter, although that does not mean he will stop tweeting. Despite this headwind, Elon and Tesla have been able to grow the brand through fanfare and organic attention rather than spending blocks of marketing dollars.

· Vertical integration. Tesla owns production and the service center network. This has allowed them to offer far better services. Currently, when your Tesla is in the shop, they attempt to give all customers fully loaded up-to-date versions of their current car to get them to salivate for an upgrade. They also make house calls and are sometimes able to repair your car in your driveway. Additionally, by vertically integrating the design and production process, they own the IP for the core components of the EVs. This gives them another cost advantage. They put the core components of their cars in at cost, other players put them in at a markup from their suppliers.

· First mover advantage. Tesla has outfitted with what they believe to be the necessary equipment for self-driving technology since October of 2016. This allowed them to have customers subsidize the cost by buying the car and gave them more data than any other company to develop this highly complicated technology. They also have a large charging network. Admittedly this benefit will likely lessen as the charging network infrastructure matures.

· Legacy costs. As in Tesla has none of them, whereas legacy auto has all the transition issues. Imagine trying to be Ford or GM and you know the future is EVs. What do you do with your unionize gas engineers? Will a layoff cause a strike? You know that selling through dealers puts you at a cost disadvantage, how do you cut them out of the deal? States have regulations that don’t allow dealers and manufactures to be owned by the same entity. How do you cut out dealers for sales but keep them for service? How do you solve the above issues while also maintaining profitability because you are heavily indebted in a fairly high interest rate environment? These aren’t so much strengths of Tesla, but are weaknesses of legacy auto.

· It is really hard to put into words all the changes Tesla has made. For example, they sell cars on their website without a model year advertised. This small but subtle change should help deal with the seasonality affect of ordering. Additionally, they have been able to add differentiated features to the car that nobody else has done before causing viral free advertising just for being cool. Ludicrous mode with the Spaceballs animation, verbal commands like “open your butthole” to access the charging port. It’s a joke, I get it, but it creates real buzz and interest.

o Would $10 billion of capital be enough to re-create the company?

§ No, you would likely need far more. As of now, $26 billion has been put into to Rivian and expects to produce 25,000 cars this year. As I mentioned earlier, the lack of new brands or the ability for players to scale up in the auto industry for such a long period of time is suggestive of the very real barriers. With higher rates and a recession looming, capital may be more difficult to come by for smaller less established players.

o Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?

§ To be honest, much of the company could be replicated with capital. The big thing, is there are really no other major players who have been able to do it anywhere near as close to the scale with the financial success as Tesla.

o Are there competitive threats on the horizon?

§ Several. This is a big industry going through a significant change. When these things happen, that attracts a significant amount of capital and competition. Every major auto company is investing into EVs, new entrants are entering the space and even large competitors like Apple are looking to enter.

· **Growth**

o Is there a 90% chance that earnings will be up 5 years from now?

§ Yes, Tesla is still a relatively small player in the auto space and has great trends with past growth and future expectations.

o Is there a 50% chance earnings will continue to grow in excess of 7% per year after the 5 year period?

§ Yes, they have a long pipeline ahead of them and have investments that offer many call options on their business.

· **Watch List Decision**

o Do you honestly know enough about the industry and company to make an investment decision?

§ Kind of. Tesla is extremely complicated, operating in new industries with new technology. Its hard to say with confidence that I have a solid understanding of the factors given the increasing rate of change with energy production and auto.

o Bottom Line: Based on your answers is the company well insulated from economic and competitive shocks while able to grow for many years to come?

§ Given the competitive strengths combined with the many weaknesses of the legacy operators I feel there is a real chance to cement an advantage in this rapidly evolving space.

§ It is also worth pointing out that long term, I feel the auto industry will go on to have similar economics of the aerospace industry. In the highly regulated aerospace industry, engines are often sold at breakeven or even a loss but come with highly lucrative 20-year service contracts making for high margin recurring revenue which gives these companies much of their value. While it is unlikely that auto will get as regulated as aerospace, I do think that the car itself over time will be more and more commoditized. The breadcrumbs for this are there. Tesla could have franchised service centers to grow with far less capex, but they didn’t. Tesla could have avoided the auto insurance like every other car company, but they are pursuing it. Obviously, the holy grail in the industry is self-driving. Conquering that gives an obvious service revenue stream for customers who purchase this add-on. Additionally, they can collect transportation fees on a robo-taxi network. Self-driving and the data from it obviously gives them a leg up on legacy insurance companies in evaluating the risk of their drivers.

§ When you put the clear cost advantage with the breadcrumbs to build the future, I think it is fair to say that Tesla earns a well deserved spot on a watch list.

· **Valuation**

o Value the company

§ Ha! Difficult, very difficult!

§ 2022 Rev Expectations: $83.075 billion

§ 2025 Rev Expectations: $167.5 Billion (26% CAGR)

§ 2028 rev Expectations: $315.7 Billion (23.5% CAGR from ’25 to ’28)

§ Shares outstanding as of 10/18/22 were 3,157,752,449

§ Over the past 6 months shares have increased at an annual rate of \~2.0%

§ Over the past 3 years they have increased at an annual rate of \~5.4%

§ Elon has discussed, but not started a buyback. Given their additional scale, and sufficient capital, I think it is prudent to project a lesser share count increase going forward. I will assume a 1% to 4% increase in shares.

§ This implies shares outstanding of 3.253 billion to 3.552 billion 3 years from now.

§ Since scale had been achieved, FCF margins have increased steadily to 11.9%. While a recession is likely to lower margins, long term additional service revenues and scale could easily raise them. I think a midpoint expectation of 14% with a range of 7% to 21% is probably fair.

§ To model a bear scenario I assumed a 25% reduction in revenue for the 2025 target to model effects from a recession and slower rollout of self-driving. For a bull case I assumed a 10% premium to the revenue target to assume better adoption. This gives us a revenue range $127.5 billion and $187.1 billion for ’25.

§ At a 7% FCF margin with 3.552 billion shares outstanding on revenue of $125.6 billion we get FCF per share of $2.46 in our bear case. With a 21% FCF margin on $184.2 billion of revenue with 3.253 billion shares we get a bullish FCF per share of 11.88.

§ With growth expectations in 2028 slowing but still high overall, I will assume a FCF yield between 2.5% to 5% for 2025.

§ When you put it all together you get an estimated value in 2025 of $98 to $237 per share for a mid-point of $168.05

§ With a current price of $123, this implies an annual return of 12% per year at the midpoint from these levels. The bull case implies a 25% CAGR and the bear case implies a loss of 6% per year.

o Would it be a prudent investment to buy the company at current levels?

§ For me, I feel that given the uncertainty in the future of the industry and company overall I would want to earn a 15% per year on an investment on Tesla. Currently, my estimates suggest a 12% rate of return. To potentially earn 15%, Tesla would need to be purchased for a price less than $112. This leaves it marginally overvalued. It really boils down to what it always does, if you believe they will execute on the vision that has been laid out. If that is the case, gains will likely be quite nice from these levels.

Elon Musk believes Bill Gates had a big short position on Tesla (TSLA) and lost a lot of money,650,0.9,308,2021-02-12,"Elon Musk revealed that he has heard that Bill Gates had a big short position on Tesla (TSLA), and he might have lost a lot of money on it.


 
Billionaires Musk and Gates don’t always have good words to say about each other, but they do appear to share similar concerns about climate change.

However, Gates made some strange comments about electrification last year, including that electric trucks, like the Tesla Semi, and electric airplanes will “probably never” work.

In a new interview on the Joe Rogan Experience, Musk was asked about those comments from gates.

Tesla’s CEO responded:

“He didn’t know what he was talking about. Probably somebody told him that and he is just not that close to the physics of it. I don’t think he is ill-intentioned here, I just think he doesn’t know what he is talking about.”

He added Tesla already has working prototypes of electric trucks that are transporting cargo – something that we already pointed out in our original report about Gates’ comment, including the fact that not only Tesla has working electric semi truck programs, but also other automakers like Daimler.

But then Musk revealed that he has heard that Gates was betting against Tesla with a large short position:

“I also heard that at one point he had a large short position. I don’t know if that’s true or not, but it seems weird. People I know who know the situation pretty well, I asked them “are you sure?” and they said “yes, he has a huge short position on Tesla”. That didn’t work out too well.”

We have reached out to Gates’ foundation to see if we could get a comment on Musk’s claim, and we will update if we get an answer.

Tesla has sometimes been the most shorted stock on the NASDAQ, and people who bet against the electric automaker lost $38 billion in 2020.

Question: What am I missing with Tesla?,235,0.79,459,2022-09-27,"The stock has been trading at P/Es that are absolutely stunning for years now. It's a car-company, in my view, as it's money is mainly being made in cars and I see no indicators of that drastically shifting in the near future.

Add to that that Tesla is a high-end car company and we're heading into an economic hurricane which might be worse than '08 (at least in Europe and Asia due to energy prices) and other car-companies adopting EV technology and Intel's Mobileye gaining ground in the autonomous driving software sector.

So, what gives? Even if Tesla was a company that was as great as the fans claim it to be, isn't the rule that you can overpay for a good company?

As you can see, I'm bearish on Tesla stock (not the business but the stock), so that's my bias. I'd like to understand the other side of the coin."
Tesla stock collapse - All you need to know - Part 1,232,0.72,379,2022-12-25,"Tesla ($TSLA) is down 69% YTD. Although this is a number that Elon musk normally finds funny, I think, in this case, he might make an exception.

In my opinion, there are 5 reasons that led to the collapse of the share price and the goal of this post is to lay them down as well as the impact of each.

***Part 2 will follow on the valuation in full (including all assumptions made) - This post became too long and in my experience, extremely long posts do poorly.***

&#x200B;

**Reason #1: Elon Musk acquired Twitter - leading to him having less time available for Tesla**

Although Elon Musk is involved in many companies other than Tesla (SpaceX, The boring company, Neuralink), there is no doubt that Twitter is the one taking most of his time at this very moment. This acquisition wasn't welcomed by the shareholders of Tesla.

**The impact:** In my opinion, the role of Elon Musk in all companies is to find the right people for the right positions and assemble teams that do the job well. Then, it's all about translating his vision into actions. The better the teams are executing, the less Elon Musk is needed on daily basis. Although this event had an impact on the time he spends on Tesla, I'm sure if there's a critical decision, Elon will give priority to Tesla over Twitter. Hence, looking into the future, I cannot imagine that Tesla's performance (from a fundamental point of view) will deteriorate.

**Reason #2: Insiders selling**

Over the last 365 days, there has been a lot of insider selling.

|Name|\# of shares sold|Average price|Total|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Elon Musk|97,004,591|$246.94|$23,954,081,846|
|Vaibhav Taneja|58,683|$337.81|$19,823,747|
|Zach Kirkhorn|52,418|$253.05|$13,264,312|
|Drew Balgino|147,601|$277.45|$40,951,954|
|Kathleen Wilson-Thompson|105,000|$289.03|$30,348,062|
|Robyn M Denholm|299,700|$284.84|$85,366,262|
|**Total**|**97,667,993**|**$247.20**|**$24,143,836,183**|

Of course, it is obvious that the biggest sale was in order to acquire Twitter and most recently (in December) to secure more funds as Twitter is not profitable.

However, there have been many insiders in high-level positions who were selling shares and the average price is almost always above $250 (more than 2x where the share price is today). In my opinion, they were selling as the company was **overvalued.** Could I be wrong? Absolutely.

**The impact:** Economics101 - when there's a significant change in supply/demand, there's a change in the price. When there is over $24b worth of shares dumped on the market, it causes a decline in the share price. Was this a significant reason for the decline? Absolutely! Do I blame the insiders? Not really, it is their choice to sell shares. As for Elon, I don't think that if his ownership is up or down by a few %, it has an impact on the level of involvement.

**Reason #3: FED increase in interest rate**

So far, this is what Elon Musk has been pointing to the most as an explanation for the share price decline. Although the increase from 0% to 4% treasury rate has an impact on the valuation of companies, it **does not** justify a decrease of 69%. Blaming the rate hikes for a stock price fall is the same as saying the stock was overvalued before, based on artificially cheap money.

Elon Musk in a Twitter Space conversation referred to the real interest rate being close to 6%. What does this mean? The nominal interest rate is somewhere around 4%, which means, he believes the inflation is negative 2% - We're in deflation. In the same conversation, he mentioned that the FED is using outdated data to make decisions today. Is he right or wrong, well, it's difficult to prove as there's no such data publicly available.

**The impact:** I do believe that this was responsible for roughly 30% of the decline of the share price, but it was pretty much normalizing back from an artificially inflated level. However, this is already embedded in the share price today. If Elon is right and we are in deflation, the FED will decrease rates which will push the share price up in the future.

**Reason #4: Interest rate impact on Tesla's business**

If you buy a car or a house and you pay for it in case, well, it doesn't matter whether the interest rate is 0% or 10%, you're not getting any loan. However, the majority of such purchases are made using a loan.

If we take a look at the total cost paid by the buyer, it is equal to the cost of the car (What Tesla is being paid) + the cost of debt (in the form of interest). Hence, even if Tesla keeps the prices exactly the same, the cost from a buyer's perspective increases when interest rates go up.

So, what can Tesla do? There are 2 options:

1. Keep prices the same - This will lead to lower volume sold, but profitability (on a unit level) remains the same.
2. Lower the price - This will lead to higher volume, but lower profitability (on a unit level)

Based on the conversation in Twitter Spaces, it seems as if Tesla it is more likely to go for the second option and focus on selling more cars.

**The impact:** In the short run, it might seem like a bad decision, but I do believe it is the right decision in the long run. They'll be able to expose more customers to their products and increase market share. There's no car company that is better positioned to make a decision such as this one.

**Reason #5: It was overvalued in the first place**

None of the reasons above and all of them combined, do not justify the 69% price drop. There were many Tesla bears shouting that the stock was overvalued above $200, let alone at $400/share. I've valued Tesla multiple times in the last few years and I got to the same conclusion over and over again. I couldn't justify the high price based on the fundamentals.

**So, why am I buying?**

Based on my assumptions, Tesla is fairly valued at around $600b (roughly $190/share). That's why in November I opened a Tesla position and increased it during December. None of the reasons above have a significant negative forward-looking impact.

The market tends to have short-term memory. The focus is on the 69% YTD decline, however, it's still up almost 500% in the last 5 years!

The sentiment has shifted significantly, from everything going right for Tesla, optimism about AI day, Optimus leading to wishful thinking, to more realistic thinking, and now more recently, panic selling.

Could I be wrong? Absolutely! This is just my take.

*Tesla shares sank in premarket trading on Monday, while China’s Li Auto plummeted to an 11-month low, after both companies slashed prices of their electric vehicles in various markets amid intense competition.*  
*U.S. EV giant Tesla cut the starting price of its Model 3 in China to 231,900 yuan ($32,000) on Sunday, a reduction of 14,000 yuan, as reported by Reuters. The report also said it had slashed prices in other major markets, like Germany.*  
*Meanwhile, Li Auto cut prices for its models, including the L7, L8, L9, and the newly launched MEGA SUV, it said on its Weibo account on Monday. The cuts for the models were reportedly up to 30,000 yuan.*  
*Checks by CNBC of both Tesla and Li Auto websites on Monday showed their vehicles were listed at the updated prices.*  
*Hong Kong-listed shares of Li Auto fell 8.3% to their lowest level in 11 months during the Monday session, while shares of other Chinese EV makers also fell — Nio was down 1.7%, Xpeng off 1.9% and BYD down 0.2%.*

"Unlike popular opinion, Tesla's valuation is far from unjustifiable - An analysis based on the numbers",270,0.68,597,2022-01-28,"While the overwhelming sentiment around this sub still seems to be that Tesla's valuation is unjustifiable, I have yet to see someone explain that using real data instead of reasoning by analogy (""but Toyota/VW sell X cars"" and is only worth Y""). Looking purely at the numbers, it seems to me Tesla is starting to become insanely undervalued.

This post is largely based on a recent video by Tesla Daily. I believe links to YouTube aren't allowed, but it's his Jan 28th video for anyone who wants to see the detailed version.

So here are the numbers:

After Tesla's Q4 earnings and subsequent 11.5% drop in stock price, its market cap dropped to $833B. Total GAAP earnings for 2021 came in at $5.5B, giving us a PE ratio of 151. ""Ridiculous!"" I hear you say.

Well not so fast. Tesla's earnings in 2021 were up 665%, Q4 earnings was up 760% YoY and earnings in Q1 were just 1/6th of Q4. If we annualize Q4 (basically projecting 0% growth in 2022), we're already at a GAAP net income of $9.3B, or a forward PE of 90.

Now obviously Tesla won't be doing 0% growth in 2022, so let's look at some of the things that seem a given.

First of all, Tesla ""paid"" $910M in stock-based compensation to Elon Musk in 2022 for his CEO compensation plan. For 2022, there is only $65M of that plan left. Since this affects GAAP earnings, this will already mean an $845M increase to Tesla's 2022 earnings. Of course there might be a new compensation plan in the future, but this almost definitely won't affect 2022 and it would only come into effect if the stock rise significantly (I'm personally expecting it to be a plan for $2, 3, 4, ..., 10T in market cap)

Next, Tesla had an increase in SG&A of $340M because of Elon exercising his options. This was a one-time expense that will not occur in 2022. Adding these together, that's an added $1,185M to Tesla's bottom line in 2022, all other things equal. This would bring their PE down to 79.

Then we've got growth. In the earnings call, Tesla mentioned how they expect to ""comfortable exceed 50%"" from their two existing factories, meaning they will sell at least 1.4M cars from Fremont and Shanghai alone. While scaling these factories might further improve margins due to economies of scale, let's pretend margin stays flat for these factories. Although this would likely increase GAAP net income by more than 50% (because not all costs would increase 50%, as we could see last year when revenue gross profit grew 135% but GAAP net income grew 760%), let's be super conservative and assume this increases GAAP net income by 50%. This adds up to $2.3B * 4 * 0.5 = $4.6B for the full year.

Now finally, just to appease the bears, let's fully back out regulatory credits even though these are unlikely to go to $0 in 2022. In 2021 this was a total of $314M.

Adding all of these up: 9.3 + 1.2 + 4.6 - 0.3 = $14.8B in net income for the full year 2022. This would give us a forward PE of 56 for a company that's at worst growing earnings 50% per year, or a PEG ratio of around 1.

Now all of this doesn't take into account any of the many catalysts that are coming up for Tesla. Obviously they've just started production in two factories that are each larger than their two current factories combined, they will no longer need to ship (for insanely expensive rates atm) cars to Europe, the new factories will have new technologies like the single-piece casting for rear and front underbodies (which is much faster and cheaper), there's an $8,000 EV incentive that might be coming back and would force Tesla to raise unit prices to prevent demand from getting out of hand, and all of the more speculative stuff like FSD, Tesla bot, Autobidder and energy/solar in general, etc.

Finally, if you still think a forward PE of 56 in the absolute worst case is too expensive, let's have a look at a comparable company in history. In 2016, Amazon also did an EPS of $4.90, after a year of 290% EPS growth. As we stated before, Tesla this year grew 760%, yet Amazon was also right around $830 a share at that time so both traded around the same PE. Looking at the growth in the next years, Amazon grew to $6.15 in 2017 and $20.14 in 2018, whereas we just established Tesla will at worst be growing to ~$15.00 in 2022 and 2023 will see Giga Texas and Berlin starting mass volume production. Just to give you an idea for comparison, Amazon's stock price grew to $1700 based on these earnings.

So having gone through all these numbers, while you can have doubts about how long Tesla will sustain this growth in car sales and whether their other businesses (energy/software/robotics/AI) will ever become a material part of the business, I think it's safe to say that anyone who says Tesla's valuation is ""nowhere near justified"" simply hasn't done the research.

"Roadside Tesla Semi fire where temperatures reached 1,000 degrees draws in NTSB investigative team",207,0.9,72,2024-08-22,"A crash and large fire along a California freeway involving an electric Tesla Semi has drawn the attention of federal safety investigators.

The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday it’s sending a team of investigators from the Office of Highway Safety mainly to look into fire risks posed by lithium-ion batteries.

The team will work with the California Highway Patrol to “examine the wreckage and gather details about the events leading up to the collision and the subsequent fire response,” the agency said in a statement.

The Los Angeles Times reported that the Tesla rig was traveling east on Interstate 80 around 3:15 a.m. Monday near Emigrant Gap, about 70 miles (113 kilometers) northeast of Sacramento, when it went off the road and collided with trees near the right shoulder.

The battery caught fire, spewing toxic fumes and reaching a temperature of 1,000 degrees, forcing firefighters to wait for it to burn out, the Highway Patrol told the newspaper. The Tesla driver walked away from the crash and was taken to a hospital, and the freeway was temporarily closed.

The battery burned into the late afternoon while firefighters tried to cool it down for cleanup, and the freeway didn’t reopen until 7:20 p.m., authorities said.

A message was left Thursday seeking comment on the crash and fire from Tesla.

After an investigation that ended in 2021 the NTSB determined that high-voltage electric vehicle battery fires pose risks to first responders and that guidelines from manufacturers about how to deal with them were inadequate.

The agency, which has no enforcement powers and can only make recommendations, called for manufacturers to write vehicle-specific response guides for fighting battery fires and limiting chemical thermal runaway and reignition. The guidelines also should include information on how to safely store vehicles with damaged lithium-ion batteries, the agency said.

Tesla began delivering the electric Semis in December of 2022, more than three years after CEO Elon Musk said his company would start making the trucks. Musk has said the Semi has a range per charge of 500 miles (800 kilometers) when pulling an 82,000-pound (37,000-kilo) load.

* Fain plans to use record contracts recently won with General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler-parent Stellantis to assist in the union’s embattled organizing efforts elsewhere.

DETROIT – United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain wants to expand the union’s battle from the Detroit automakers to Tesla, Toyota Motor and other non-unionized automakers operating in the U.S.

The outspoken leader plans to use record contracts recently won after contentious negotiations and U.S. labor strikes with General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler-parent Stellantis to assist in the union’s embattled organizing efforts elsewhere.

“We’ve created the threat of a good example, and now we’re going to build on it,” Fain said Thursday night when discussing Stellantis’ tentative agreement. “We just went on strike like we’ve never been on strike before and won a historic contract as a result. Now we’re going to organize like we’ve never organized before.”

Doing so would greatly assist the union’s bargaining efforts and membership, which has been nearly halved from roughly 700,000 members in 2001 to 383,000 at the beginning of this year. UAW membership peaked at 1.5 million in 1979.

The UAW has previously failed to organize foreign-based automakers in the U.S. Most recently, plants with Volkswagen
and Nissan Motor fell short of the support needed to unionize. The UAW has previously discussed organizing Tesla’s Fremont plant in California with little to no traction in those efforts.

It remains to be seen whether the recent efforts are gaining traction at any other automakers, but Fain has vowed to move beyond the “Big Three” — Ford, GM and Stellantis — and expand to the “Big Five or Big Six” by the time its 4½-year contracts with the Detroit automakers expire in April 2028.

The deals include 25% wage increases that would boost top pay to more than $40 an hour, reinstatement of cost-of-living adjustments, enhanced profit-sharing payments and other significant pay, healthcare and workplace benefits. The contracts must still be ratified.

The union has already received significant interest from non-union automakers in light of the tentative agreements, Fain said. And last month, he rejected comments from Ford Chair Bill Ford arguing the company and union should be working together to battle non-American automakers.

“Workers at Tesla, Toyota, Honda, and others are not the enemy — they’re the UAW members of the future,” Fain said. 

**Toyota**

Fain has taken particular aim at Toyota in recent days.

The automaker earlier this week confirmed plans to hike wages at its U.S. factories. The new rates would see hourly manufacturing employees at top rates in Kentucky receive roughly 9% pay increases to $34.80 an hour.

Fain on Thursday called that pay raise “the UAW bump,” joking that UAW stands for “U Are Welcome” to join the union’s movement. 

“Toyota isn’t giving out raises out of the goodness of their heart,” Fain said. “They could have just as easily raised wages a month ago or a year ago. They did it now because the company knows we’re coming for ’em.”

Toyota, which has 49,000 hourly and salaried U.S. workers, said the “decision to unionize is ultimately made by our team members.”

“By engaging in honest, two-way communication about what’s happening in the company, we aim to foster positive morale which ultimately leads to increased productivity,” the company said Friday in an emailed statement. “Working together has provided a history of stable employment and income for our team members.”

**Tesla**

The UAW has so far not been able to establish enough support to force an organizing vote at Tesla’s facilities, including its Fremont, California, plant where the union previously represented workers when it was a GM-Toyota joint venture.

Fain on Thursday told Bloomberg News he believes organizing Tesla and taking on CEO Elon Musk is “doable.”

“We can beat anybody,” Fain told Bloomberg. “It’s gonna come down to the people that work for him deciding if they want their fair share... or if they want him to fly himself to outer space at their expense.”

Still, Musk has historically clashed with union proponents.

As some workers sought to form a union at the company’s Fremont factory in in 2017 and 2018, Tesla was paying a consultancy named MWW PR to monitor employees in a Facebook group and on social media more broadly, as CNBC previously reported.

Tesla also terminated the employment of a union activist named Richard Ortiz in 2017. And in 2018, Musk said in a tweet, “Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues & give up stock options for nothing?”

The tweet violated federal labor laws, the National Labor Relations Board later found.

An administrative court ordered Tesla to reinstate Ortiz and to have Musk delete his tweet, which it concluded had threatened workers’ compensation. Tesla appealed the ruling, and Musk’s offending post remains on the social media platform which Musk now owns, has rebranded as X and runs as CTO and executive chairman.

In February, a different group of organizers filed a complaint with the NLRB claiming that Tesla had fired more than 30 employees at its Buffalo facility in retaliation for a union push there by Tesla Workers United. Tesla called the workers’ allegations false, saying 4% of its Autopilot data labeling team in Buffalo had been terminated due to performance issues.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the federal agency responsible for enforcing civil rights laws against workplace discrimination, sued Tesla in September, alleging widespread racist harassment of Black workers, and retaliation against those who spoke out.

And in late October, just over 100 of Tesla’s service employees in Sweden, members of the industrial labor group IF Metall, walked off the job for a short strike. Hundreds of mechanics and technicians at non-Tesla shops also agreed not to repair any of the EV makers’ cars in solidarity. However, Tesla has so far refused to negotiate with IF Metall.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

Summary:

\- Most of the article is about VW (maybe sponsored by VW? :-) )

\- VW become the #1 EV maker in EU last year

\----EV cars sales in EU: Dec 2019: TSLA: 110K , VW 46K;  Dec 2020: TSLA: 96K, VW: 174K

\- VW CEO (Diess) using the same strategy as Musk (creating media hype, ""power day"" similar to ""battery day, etc), stock has gone up 80% ytd, meme stock potential

\- This year, VW plans to deliver 1 million plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles, and Diess aims to surpass Tesla in EV sales no later than 2025. Some analysts predict it will happen much sooner.

\- VW can exploit something Tesla doesn’t have much of yet: scale. Dozens of brands that fill every nook and cranny of the auto market—and sales last year of 9.3 million vehicles (compared to TSLA's 0.5 million).

\- By 2025, VW and its partners will have more than 35,000 public chargers around the world, and planning half a dozen battery factories in EU.

\- VW aims to sell 26 million EVs  in the next 10 years

\- Other legacy auto makers following suit (e.g. GM planning to phase out diesel cars by 2035, Hyundai planning almost two dozen new models, Renualt having a super hit in EU with model Zoe, Ford's Mustang Mach-E)

\- Chinese companies rolling out budget EV models

\- Tons of new companies/SPACs (Rivian, Lucid, etc)

\- Just like netflix that paved the way for streaming video is now facing great competition from ""legacy"" companies like disney, HBO, amazon, etc, TSLA will also face the same struggle with the EV market, specially when the giants like Apple, Amazon, Google have EV ambitions of themselves

\- (maybe positive for TSLA) the biggest automaker in the world Toyota, still not fully committed to EV, and some major automakers like BMW do not think ""only EV after year xxxx"" is a good strategy because there are like 160 countries/markets to consider

&#x200B;

Opinion:

\- would have been nice to get some analysis about the software/AI aspect, as that is one of the main thing that TSLA is way ahead of others and legacy car makers seem to be struggling with

\- Chinese companies barely mentioned (and also aspects such as the recent Chinese rule of not using TSLA cars in military sensitive areas due to the cameras, which may give acceleration to LADAR based cars rather than camera based Evs, and I doubt TSLA will shift to that one..)

&#x200B;

What do you think?

I thin the EV pie is very big and there is room for many. TSLA will be dominant for at least the next few years (maybe until 2025) and then maybe others will catch up if they play their cards right and some politics (like China) plays in their favour.

PS: I don't have a position in TSLA (wanted to get in when it dipped but was waiting for sub 550 which didn't happen). I have small position in VW and Nio.

EDIT 1: Just for the heck of it, I just bought a couple of TSLA at 655.

EDIT 2: added 2 more TSLA at 638.

Tesla decides against state aid for German battery plant as Musk opposes subsidies,525,0.88,248,2021-11-26,"* Tesla withdraws application for state funding
* All subsidies should be eliminated, Musk tweets
* Car plant construction progressing well - economy ministry
* Regional funding application still underway

BERLIN, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Tesla (TSLA.O) said on Friday it has withdrawn its application for state aid for its planned battery factory near Berlin as CEO Elon Musk declared the electric vehicle maker opposed all subsidies.

The European Union in January approved a plan that included giving state aid to Tesla, BMW (BMWG.DE) and others to support production of electric vehicle batteries and help the bloc to reduce imports from industry leader China.

Tesla was expected to receive 1.14 billion euros ($1.28 billion) in EU funding for its battery plant in Gruenheide, Brandenburg under the plan, with a final decision likely by the end of the year.

""Tesla has informed the Federal Ministry of Economics and the Brandenburg Ministry of Economics... it is withdrawing its IPCEI application for state funding for the battery factory in Grünheide,"" a Tesla spokesperson said, referring to European subsidies allocated to so-called 'Important Projects of Common European Interest'.

Construction plans for the plant would not be affected by the decision, the spokesperson said.

""It has always been Tesla’s view that all subsidies should be eliminated,"" Musk posted on Twitter in response to a tweet by another user after Tesla said it had withdrawn its funding application.

""But that must include the massive subsidies for oil & gas. For some reason, governments don’t want to do that...,"" Musk added, deviating from the subject of the factory grant.

Tesla itself is investing 5 billion euros in the battery plant, according to German economy ministry estimates.

Meanwhile, construction of a car production site alongside the battery plant, which Tesla has begun building under pre-approval permits while it awaits final approval from the regional government, has made good progress in the last few weeks, a spokesperson for the federal economy ministry said.

The electric vehicle maker also applied in November 2020 for regional funding from Brandenburg, according to the regional government's website.

A Brandenburg economy ministry spokesperson said this application had not been withdrawn.

The amount Tesla applied for is undisclosed, but investments worth over 100 million euros are generally given 6.8% of their value, the website says.

The latest round of online consultations for the public to express environmental and other concerns about the car factory and battery plant closed last week and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said he hopes to formally begin production by the end of the year and then ramp up as quickly as possible.

Musk has made his irritation for German laws and processes known, saying in a letter to authorities in April that the country's complex planning requirements were at odds with the urgency needed to fight climate change.

Their stock has grown rapidly the last 4 years to as high as $407.36 a share and recently dropped as low as $108 and now it's back to $198. It is the biggest or close to the biggest electric vehicle company in the world and easily the biggest in the US controlling a large share of an expanding market and they seem to do well in most quarterly earnings reports. That alone would seem to give them a pretty good valuation. 

But is their value inflated even at its current price? What do experienced investors think. Thanks"

I'm not here to convince anyone of anything, but here are some questions to ask yourself:

&#x200B;

* Is Tesla's data lead (2 orders of magnitude and counting....360k vehicles on the road right now sending training data back to base at every driver intervention) unassailable?
* Does Tesla have the best, cheapest and most energy efficient self driving computer?
* Has Tesla built custom software for their custom hardware which will provide efficiencies no one else can match unless they too build their own full self driving (FSD) hardware and software?
* Will Tesla be first to achieve (FSD)?
* Will Tesla be first to gain regulatory approval for FSD?
* Is Tesla the ONLY vehicle manufacturer producing FSD-ready vehicles RIGHT NOW?
* Will Tesla's Model 3 drive train last 1 million+ miles?
* Will the new battery (next year) last 1 million+ miles?
* Will Uber, Lyft, Waymo raise capital and run at enormous losses so they can cut their ride costs by 100-200% to compete with the Tesla robo taxis, or will they begin building or buying their own vehicles. If so, who from?
* What will happen to the value of existing vehicles on the road when Tesla achieves FSD?
* What will happen to company valuations of ICE manufacturers who haven't transitioned ALL new vehicles to electric AND full self driving when the first EV manufacturer achieves FSD?
* What will happen to Tesla's net profit when they ""turn on"" their robo taxi fleet, taking 25-30% of all user-owned rides, and 100% of all Tesla-owned rides? Approx cashflow analysis suggests a $38,000 (retail) Model 3 will generate $30,000/yr in the fleet, and last 10 years. **READ THAT AGAIN**. A $38,000 asset (built for less, but consumers can buy for that) can ROI \~80% in year 1.... year 2 and beyond is pure cream.
* Did Tesla executed on EVERYTHING in the ""Secret Tesla Master Plan"" of 2006 ( [https://www.tesla.com/blog/secret-tesla-motors-master-plan-just-between-you-and-me](https://www.tesla.com/blog/secret-tesla-motors-master-plan-just-between-you-and-me) )?
* Is Tesla on the way to executing EVERYTHING in Master Plan Part Deux ([https://www.tesla.com/BLOG/MASTER-PLAN-PART-DEUX](https://www.tesla.com/BLOG/MASTER-PLAN-PART-DEUX))?
* Who is poised to produce an equivalent or better vehicle at scale?

'The Big Short' investor Michael Burry says Elon Musk may want to sell Tesla stock to cover his personal debts,541,0.88,222,2021-11-09,"*  **Michael Burry suggested Elon Musk might want to sell some Tesla stock to cover his personal debts.**
* **""The Big Short"" investor noted the Tesla CEO had 88 million shares pledged as loan collateral.**

Michael Burry rejoined Twitter this week to suggest why Elon Musk is suddenly interested in selling [**Tesla**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/tsla-stock?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest) stock, and to sound the alarm on dangerous speculation in financial markets.

## Musk's debts

""Regarding what u/elonmusk NEEDS to sell because of the proposed unrealized gains tax, or to #solveworldhunger, or ... well, there is the matter of the tax-free cash he took out in the form of personal loans backed by 88.3 million of his shares at June 30th,"" the investor [**tweeted**](https://twitter.com/michaeljburry/status/1457902467669127170).

Musk [**recently offered**](https://www.businessinsider.com/musk-sell-tesla-stock-if-6-billion-solves-world-hunger-2021-11?r=US&IR=T?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest) to sell $6 billion worth of Tesla stock if UN bosses could explain to him how the sum would solve world hunger. The Tesla CEO also [**launched a Twitter poll**](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-proposes-selling-10-percent-tesla-stock-twitter-poll-2021-11?r=US&IR=T?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest) asking whether he should sell 10% of his holdings, citing pressure from US lawmakers who are pushing for a ""[**billionaire tax**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/taxing-billionaires-would-raise-557-billion-elon-musk-billionaire-tax2021-11?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest)"" that would target the ultra-wealthy's unrealized stock gains.

Burry's tweet implies those might just be excuses. The investor of ""The Big Short"" fame and head of Scion Asset Management posted a link to a SEC filing in August, which noted that Musk has pledged about 88 million shares, or 36% of his total stake, as collateral for personal loans as of June 30.

Musk had 41% of his shares pledged as collateral for his debts at the end of December last year, and 48% as of June 30 last year, previous filings show.

Burry appears to be suggesting that Musk isn't eyeing a stock sale in order to feed millions of people, in response to a legislative proposal, or because he could [**face a $10 billion tax bill**](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tesla-stock-sale-options-twitter-poll-2021-11?r=US&IR=T?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest) when he exercises a slew of stock options that expire in August 2022.

Instead, Burry's theory is that Musk needs some cash to service the loans he's taken out using his Tesla stock. That practice [**drew heavy scrutiny**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-criticized-avoiding-taxes-deserves-break-philanthropy-lifestyle-loopholes-2021-6?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest) this summer after a [**ProPublica investigation**](https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax) detailed how some of the world's wealthiest people borrow against their stock to minimize their tax burdens.

## Bubble fears

Besides tweeting about Musk, Burry marked his return to Twitter with a new [**header image**](https://twitter.com/michaeljburry/header_photo). His choice of ""Satire of the Tulip Mania,"" a painting by Jan Brueghel the Younger that ridicules the [**Dutch tulip bubble**](https://www.businessinsider.com/tulipmania-bubble-story-2014-9?r=US&IR=T?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest) in the 1600s, is undoubtedly a fresh warning about the current market mania.

The painting depicts tulip speculators as mindless monkeys, and shows them weighing the bulbs, counting money, taking inventory, and going into debt, fighting over, and even dying for the flowers.

Burry has [**painted**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/big-short-michael-burry-tweets-tesla-robinhood-bitcoin-gamestop-bubble-2021-3?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest) the immense hype around meme stocks and cryptocurrencies, and the frantic buying of Tesla shares and other assets, as clear signs of rampant speculation.

Moreover, Burry has diagnosed a [**historic market bubble**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-warns-stocks-options-dotcom-bubble-crash-2021-9?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest) and [**predicted a devastating crash**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/big-short-michael-burry-warns-meme-stocks-crypto-crash-coming-2021-6?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest) in recent months. His fund also [**held bearish put options**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-elon-musk-tesla-cathie-wood-ark-2021-8?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest) on shares of Tesla and Cathie Wood's Ark Invest at the end of June. Given that context, his choice of Twitter image suggests he sees history repeating itself.
